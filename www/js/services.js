Pre-diabetes is associated with a variety of serious medical conditions, including heart disease, stroke, and, of course, diabetes. It's vital to know the symptoms of pre-diabetes and always watch for their development. If you catch the symptoms early on, you can drastically reduce your chances of reaching pre-diabetes and eventually diabetes. Failure to do so, however, has major consequences.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we outline the key signs of pre-diabetes that you must not ignore. Let's walk you through a list of them so that you can do a self-check right now and then keep on the lookout for any of them developing.<\/p>\n<h4>Feeling Tired After Eating<\/h4>\n<p>The first symptom to be on the lookout for is if you start to feel very tired and sluggish after a meal containing carbohydrates. If you eat carbs and your body isn't processing them correctly, this can lead to ongoing fatigue and muscle weakness.<\/p>\n<p>While most people will feel tired if they eat a very high carb meal or simply too many calories at once, if you are noticing this even after a lighter meal containing 25-50 grams of carbohydrates, it could be a sign that something's up.<\/p>\n<h4>High Cravings For Carbohydrates<\/h4>\n<p>At the same time, if you often find yourself craving carbohydrates or sugar foods for that matter, this too can be a sign of diabetes. Realize that there is a difference though between a psychological craving because you simply have come to love sugar-dense foods and a feeling like you must eat carbohydrates because your blood sugar is low.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel shaky, jittery, anxious, or like you might faint, these are all classic signs of low blood glucose levels and could indicate your body isn't responding to insulin as it should.<\/p>\n<h4>Excess Body Weight Focused Around The Stomach<\/h4>\n<p>The next symptom to be aware of is excess fat, particularly focused around the midsection. If you have more of an apple shape to your body than a pear, you are holding your fat in areas that are particularly dangerous for those who are trying to fend off diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Apple shapes store fat in central locations around the organs, which can cause a higher likelihood of insulin resistance developing, which will then lead to full blown diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Not to mention fat in this region is also far more dangerous as far as heart disease is concerned, so that's yet another reason to be aiming to lose weight if this is where you're storing it.<\/p>\n<h4>High Blood Pressure<\/h4>\n<p>Finally, if you have high blood pressure levels, this should not go ignored. Many people tend to think of high blood pressure as being a sign for heart disease, but in addition to that, it's also a sure-fire sign diabetes could be right around the corner.<\/p>\n<p>High blood pressure levels along with elevated triglycerides and cholesterol are also all a sign of pre-diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>So keep these warning symptoms in mind and be on the lookout for them at all times. If you notice any appearing, take action immediately to reverse them so that you don't become impacted by type 2 diabetes.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/pre-diabetes.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"In this article, we outline the key signs of pre-diabetes that you must not ignore.

Now is the best time to enjoy local offerings of this delightful delicacy. Not only is asparagus a great flavor to have on the plate, but it is also a veritable superfood of the vegetable world.<\/p>\n<p>For about 5000 years, people have been cultivating asparagus for its medicinal and nutritional values, starting with the Ancient Egyptians. Though most commonly available in the traditional green variety, both white and purple variations can be found. Whatever kind you settle on, incorporating asparagus into your diet will not only be a delicious choice, but provide numerous health benefits as well, as this article will show you.<\/p>\n<h4>Health Benefits<\/h4>\n<p>Since ancient times, asparagus has been revered for its health benefits, and it is easy to see why. Asparagus's delicious green spears contain high levels of antioxidants and a multitude of B-vitamins. Together, these components have the capability of reducing the risk of inflammation and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, and obesity, as well as regulating blood sugar. Studies also indicate that these nutrients may also contribute to risk reduction for certain types of cancer. The ancients may not have known it, but eating asparagus may have reduced their risk of developing Leukemia and liver cancer, and could do the same for you.<\/p>\n<h4>Storage<\/h4>\n<p>Unlike most vegetables, asparagus doesn't instantly die when it is harvested. In fact, asparagus spears continue to metabolize after being cut from their source. This makes asparagus one of the more perishable vegetables. To keep up with this continued metabolism, asparagus should be kept moist by wrapping its cut ends in a wet paper towel, then refrigerating it. This prevents asparagus from drying out and hardening. Asparagus should be eaten within the first couple of days that it is purchased to ensure freshness.<\/p>\n<h4>Preparation<\/h4>\n<p>Asparagus is a versatile vegetable when it comes to cooking. One of the easiest ways to cook it is to boil it for a few minutes until it becomes tender and serve it without any other preparations necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Asparagus can be easily pan-fried and combined with other great flavors, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yummly.com\/recipe\/Asparagus-with-Lime-and-Mint-Simply-Recipes-42696?columns=5&amp;position=60%2F60\"> this recipe<\/a> shows an easy way to do just that.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/asparagus.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Learn about asparagus, a veritable superfood in the vegetable world, and its health benefits.

For that reason, it is crucial that you start your morning off with the right food choices. Many of the breakfast cereals on the market today are full of added sugars, chemicals, and fats. Thus, choosing the right cereal can be the most important decision you make all day.<\/p>\n<p>With all of the unhealthy options available to you in the world of breakfast cereals, it can be hard to find one that gets your day off to a good start. This article highlights the things to look for in a healthy cereal, and what to avoid.<\/p>\n<p><br \/><strong>What to Look For:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Low sugar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Not only does having a lot of added refined sugars in your diet increase your risk for health concerns, but cereals high in sugar also provide a lot of empty calories early in the day. Cereals that have less than 10 grams of cereal per serving are ideal.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>High fiber<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Cereals high in fiber not only aid in digestion, but also help regulate blood sugar levels. Americans are especially deficient of fiber in their diets, and looking for cereals that have high levels of the nutrient is a good way to reverse that trend.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Protein<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Cereal can be a good way to get a healthy amount of protein in your system early in the day. This can curb your appetite to avoid overeating later. Also, high-protein cereals are one way you can integrate protein from sources other than red meats into your diet.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Other Ingredients<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Besides lacking in healthy ingredients, so-called &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cereals can also contain chemicals and other non-nutrients that can be harmful. A lot of cereals are made with processed, treated grains and filler material that lack in nutrition and have been linked to the development of serious medical conditions, like heart disease and even cancer. One guideline to follow is to choose cereals with a whole grain as the first ingredient. Another rule of thumb that will usually work: the fewer ingredients that you can&rsquo;t pronounce, the better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Reasonable Portions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Even if some cereals may look like they have well-balanced levels of healthy and unhealthy ingredients (preferably none of the latter) they can be tricking you with the portion size. Know how much cereal you actually eat, and if the portion size is deceptively small on the package, take that into account when calculating the true amount of the cereal&rsquo;s components. &nbsp;<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/eating-the-right-cereal-to-improve-your-diet.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"It can be hard to find a cereal that gets your day off to a good start.

Over 30% of Americans are actively trying to eat less gluten. If you're in this group, you may want to take note of a recent study that challenges conventional wisdom about gluten. Gluten is a protein found in grains like wheat and rye. In 2011, Peter Gibson, a professor of gastroenterology in Melbourne, Australia, published a study showing that gluten caused gastrointestinal distress in patients without celiac disease. This was called \"non-celiac gluten sensitivity\".<\/p>\n<p>However, Gibson was not satisfied with the reliability of his experiment. He recently released the results of a follow-up study, and they are surprising to say the least.<\/p>\n<h4>The Original Study<\/h4>\n<p>Gibson's original 2011 study was conducted on a very small group of people. His results showed that gluten, a common protein found in most of our diets, triggered gastrointestinal distress. But Gibson was not satisfied with his study for several reasons. First, his sample was too small to be very certain of the results. Second, his study found nothing about the mechanisms by which gluten caused this distress. And finally, he was skeptical that a protein that humans have eaten for thousands of years would suddenly be shown to cause a host of health problems.<\/p>\n<h4>The New Study<\/h4>\n<p>So Gibson set out to find the answer. He set up a much more sophisticated study with more subjects, controlling for every aspect of the subjects' diets, and meticulously studying their responses to different foods. His results are sure to raise hell. A billion dollar industry has grown out of the idea of \"gluten intolerance\". But Gibson - whose work first led to the gluten-free obsession - now says, \"we could find absolutely no specific response to gluten.\"<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these results are always tentative, but the recent work suggests that people do not need to worry so much about gluten and should stop self-diagnosing themselves with \"gluten intolerance\". Instead, focus on the dietary habits that we are certain of: eating more fruits and vegetables, leaner protein sources, whole grains, and nuts and oils as fat sources.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/gluten-intolerance-myth.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"The newest diet fad is gluten-free.

Believe it or not, dark chocolate does your body more good than harm.<\/p>\n<p>From having low, manageable levels of sugar, in comparison to some of your other favorite treats, to being packed full of nutrients, dark chocolate is sure to surprise you with its health benefits. In this article, we take a closer look at what exactly makes dark chocolate the wholesome treat that it is.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sugar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First and foremost, dark chocolate contains 50% less sugar than milk chocolate. Besides obviously having less of an impact on your blood sugar levels, dark chocolate also packs about 4x the amount of fiber that milk chocolate does. This helps slow the absorption rate of sugar into your bloodstream, further reducing the overall effect of the sugar in dark chocolate.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nutrients<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dark chocolate contains a myriad of vitamins, minerals, and other healthy compounds that set it apart from practically all other sweet treats. All chocolate contains trace amounts of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and potassium, but dark chocolate actually has usable levels of these minerals. In fact, dark chocolate contains somewhere in the neighborhood of 2x the amount of potassium than milk chocolate. Forget bananas as a source for your potassium, just have more dark chocolate.<\/p>\n<p>Unique to dark chocolate is a high level of a special compound called theobromine, an alkaloid found in cacao that lowers your blood pressure. This, combined with low amounts of cholesterol and high amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (which are good for you), means dark chocolate is just as healthy as some more traditional health food staples. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which Dark Chocolate to Get&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Even though it is usually a safe bet that dark chocolate is a healthier alternative to milk chocolate, all dark chocolate is not equal. Some dark chocolate contains lots of artificial flavors or emulsifying agents that are additional chemicals that aren&rsquo;t doing you any favors. Also, to truly enjoy the full benefits of dark chocolate, don&rsquo;t waste your time or money on anything with a cacao content of less than 70%.

Despite their bad reputation, eggs are actually a nearly perfect food from both a convenience and health standpoint. Notably, eggs contain a spectrum of nutrients and even help with maintaining healthy levels of the good kind of cholesterol: HDL.<\/p>\n<p>Pair this with the fact that they are by far the most versatile food you can find in your pantry, and it begins to become clear why eggs are a veritable superfood. This egg-spos&eacute; of the incredible edible egg discusses the truly remarkable qualities that this food possesses.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Nutrients<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In a single egg, you get about 10% of your suggested daily intake of vitamins A, B5, B6, B12, and B2, and around the same amount of folate, phosphorus, and selenium. Whether you are starting your day out with an egg or two, or you use them throughout your day in any of their endless applications, you are helping yourself get all of the nutrients you need without the need for supplements or special recipes.<\/p>\n<p>Also, eggs pack in over 6 grams of protein and 5 grams of unsaturated fat (that&rsquo;s the good kind) and only 77 calories per egg. This means that eggs can help fill you up with nutrients, curbing your appetite and preventing overeating.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Cholesterol<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Put simply, the myths you&rsquo;ve heard about eggs being bad for people with concerns about their cholesterol are largely false. Yes, each egg contains 212 mg of cholesterol, but this is not a bad thing, necessarily. Instead of going directly into your blood, your body, which normally <em>produces<\/em> cholesterol through the liver, recognizes the new cholesterol and adjusts its own production accordingly. In most people, this means that eating eggs has no actual effect on cholesterol levels in the blood.<\/p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, eggs boost the good HDL cholesterol and regulate the levels of LDL cholesterol. This is because they bind the small LDL molecules into larger clusters that are easier for the body to process.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Versatility<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Besides in the thousands of breakfast and brunch recipes that call for eggs, they are also the centerpieces in countless more recipes for all courses from all around the world, from Eggs Benedict to Egg Drop Soup.

Percy Cerutty, a long distance running coach, developed his theory by throwing a bucket of water at his cat. His athletes watched as the cat leapt up and ran away, avoiding the water. Percy famously asked, \"Did the cat stretch or jog about before it sprinted off at speed? Did it stretch? Nope, it just sprinted!\" Cerutty was extreme, and from that point on his athletes never stretched again.<\/p>\n<p>He may have been onto something, though. He coached in the 1940s and some 70 years later, scientists, physiologists, and exercise specialists are starting to come around. Many now agree that static stretching (the typical reach and hold stretching) is not beneficial and can even be harmful. <em>Runner's World<\/em>, for example, reports, \"There is no evidence that static stretching prevents injury or improves performance, experts now say. In fact there's some evidence that it can hurt.\"<\/p>\n<p>In truth, how you should warm up depends on what type of exercise you're doing. <em>Aerobic exercise<\/em> means low intensity exercise that lasts a long duration; for example, running, swimming, or biking. <em>Anaerobic exercise<\/em> means high intensity exercise that lasts a short duration; for example, sprinting or weightlifting. In either case, you'll definitely want to avoid static stretching.<\/p>\n<p>For aerobic exercise, your best bet is to warm up within your workout. If you're going on a run, for example, just start out very slowly and gradually build up. Even Kenyan professional long distance runners start off their runs at 10-minute-mile pace and gradually build up the pace. If the pros aren't embarrassed running so slowly, neither should you be.<\/p>\n<p>For anaerobic exercise, a dynamic warm up will get your muscles loose, active, and ready for intense exercise and improved performance. You'll want to tweak your dynamic warm up to fit your needs. For example, my hips are my tightest muscle group, so I often spend extra time loosening them up with lunges and leg swings. You might have loose hips, but tight shoulders - in that case, spend extra time on your shoulders.<\/p>\n<h4>Example Routine<\/h4>\n<p>Start by foam rolling over your tightest muscles. Roll 10 times over and back on each spot. Next, move to a full body exercise (like jump rope or rowing) for 3-5 minutes. Then focus on improving blood circulation through various body parts by performing exercises like bodyweight squats or lunges (for legs) and pushups (for chest and arms). Finally, loosen up with some dynamic flexibility movements like leg and\/or arm swings, depending how you feel. Here's a good warm up to begin with. Be sure to tweak it based on your needs.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Foam roll over quads, hamstrings, back, and glutes (10 over and back each)<\/li>\n<li>Jump rope for 3-5 minutes<\/li>\n<li>20 bodyweight squats<\/li>\n<li>10 lunges (each leg)<\/li>\n<li>2 sets of 5-10 pushups<\/li>\n<li>10 forward leg swings (each leg)<\/li>\n<li>10 side-to-side leg swings (each leg)<\/li>\n<li>10 shoulder rotations (each arm): keep your arms straight out to the side, and move your arms in circles, making bigger circles each time<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>One final tip: track your warm-up and try to beat it every workout. You don't have to beat every warm up exercise every workout. Just pick one exercise and add 30 seconds or a few reps. You can even just foam roll one more muscle if you're not feeling very energetic!<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/stretching.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"There are many theories about how best to warm up for exercise.

Manufactures maintain that the supplement helps deal with depression, aids in weight loss, and combats headaches and migraines.<\/p>\n\n<p>Is what little research on the effects of the chemical adequate reason for adding the 5-HTP to your daily supplement regimen? In this examination of 5-HTP, we take a closer look at the alleged benefits and possible risks of taking the supplement.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Where 5-HTP Comes From&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The human body naturally creates 5-HTP from dietary intake of an amino acid called tryptophan. It is unlikely, however, that eating foods with tryptophan will result in a noticeable increase in the amount of 5-HTP your body produces. For this reason, dietary supplements are manufactured from <em>Griffonia siplicifolia<\/em>, a plant native to Africa.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>How It Works<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Once 5-HTP is in your system, either through natural synthesis or from taking supplements, the body converts it into another chemical, serotonin. This is a neurotransmitter, a chemical that helps different parts of the brain communicate to each other more effectively. Low serotonin levels are linked to certain conditions such as depression, obesity, and migraines, thus the addition of 5-HTP is a logical solution. In most cases, evidence to support the effectiveness of 5-HTP to combat these conditions is lacking.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Depression<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It is known that 5-HTP increases levels of serotonin in the brain. For cases of mild-to-moderate depression, there is a class of antidepressants with the same function, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Prozac, Luvox, and Zoloft, or fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, respectively. In only a handful of small studies, a test group of 63 people found 5-HTP to be as successful as these medicines as antidepressants. These studies were far too small to be conclusive, however.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Migraines<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For people who suffer from chronic migraines headaches, doctors sometimes prescribe antidepressants for treatment. In high doses, some studies suggest that 5-HTP may also be an effective measure to treat certain types of headaches like migraines. Not all studies point in the same direction, however, with some studies showing no effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Obesity<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>The thought behind 5-HTP as a weight loss supplement is that it works as a diet suppressant. In what few studies that have been executed, test subjects who took 5-HTP but weren&rsquo;t trying to diet in any other way loss more weight than those subjects on placebo. High doses of 5-HTP cause a feeling of fullness, but can lead to nausea as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Side Effects&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>It is important to talk to your health care provider before taking any dietary supplements. While they are available over-the-counter, many supplements have potential side effects and interactions with medications that you may be at risk for.<\/p>\n\n<p>Specifically, 5-HTP usually has only mild side effects from nausea to heartburn, gas, and fullness. If taken in high doses, it is possible to amass too much serotonin in your system. This can lead to a condition called serotonin syndrome.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/what-is-5-htp.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"In this examination of 5-HTP, we take a closer look at the alleged benefits and possible risks of taking the supplement.","date_published":"2014-07-16 18:44:13","published":"1","seo_url":"what-is-5-htp.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"63741","author":"181"},{"id":"405","name":"How to Lose Weight and Conquer Diabetes","body":"<p>According to the <em>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<\/em>, almost 12 percent of the U.S. population over 20 suffers from diabetes. Almost 20 percent more show warning signs for diabetes. Obesity holds much of the responsibility for the increased prevalence of the condition. But the real culprit behind the scenes is the high consumption of processed sugar in prepared foods. Weight loss through controlling sugar intake is crucial for overweight diabetics, but \"fad\" diets can interfere with the process.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we give general diet guidelines for how to avoid fad diets, get to the root of the diabetes problem, and lose weight.<\/p>\n<h4>Why Fad Diets are Unsafe in Diabetes<\/h4>\n<p>Insulin-resistance occurs when the pancreas produces insulin, but it is not used effectively to control the sugar (glucose) level in the bloodstream. After eating a meal high in glucose (such as a sugary breakfast cereal, orange juice, and sweetened coffee), a person with diabetes can experience a spike in blood glucose. An uncontrolled blood glucose level can lead to complications such as high blood pressure, nerve pain, and kidney damage - and even a diabetic coma. Diets that involve skipping meals or intermittent fasting can lead to hypoglycemic episodes in diabetic individuals, resulting in mental confusion and seizures.<\/p>\n<p>Insulin and oral medication doses are prescribed for diabetic persons based on specific calculations of daily food intake. Some fad diets involve a drastic reduction in carbohydrate or calorie intake. The sudden weight loss that occurs as a result can produce a medication reaction in diabetics that can cause a medical emergency. Additionally, diabetic individuals need to eat a balanced diet to reduce the effects of typical diabetic complication (e.g., cardiovascular disease).<\/p>\n<h4>The Importance of Nutritional Counseling for Weight Loss<\/h4>\n<p>Obese diabetic individuals need to work closely with a trained nutritionist to create daily meal plans that enable weight loss through nutrient-rich meals. Creating an appropriate diabetic diet involves awareness and calculation of the glycemic index (GI), which rates the likely effect of each food item on blood glucose and insulin. The lower the GI, the less its predicted effect on blood glucose and insulin.<\/p>\n<p>Since high blood lipid levels (e.g., cholesterol and triglycerides) are also often a problem in diabetes, reducing cholesterol intake is especially important in designing a diabetic weight loss diet. Additionally, the dosage of medications needs to be considered in the meal planning for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (as well as snacks between meals).<\/p>\n<p>The American Diabetes Association's website includes the following food items on its list of low GI foods: oatmeal, 100 percent (stone-ground) whole wheat bread, legumes, corn, most fruits, non-starchy vegetables, and carrots. High GI foods include white bread, short grain white rice, Russet potatoes, melons, and pineapple.<\/p>\n<p>Weight reduction to achieve a targeted BMI can eliminate the need in some diabetics for insulin or oral diabetes medication. It can also reduce the likelihood of developing future complications (e.g., peripheral vascular disease).

The health benefits of yogurt, especially the sugar-free variety, go on and on.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are worried about developing health problems like high blood pressure or osteoporosis, want more protein in your diet, or just want to benefit from added nutrients from natural sources in your diet, yogurt can be a valuable part of what you eat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Good From the Start<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As long as you are getting yogurt with no added sugar, it is an innately healthy food. Plain yogurt, in its purest form, is just the combination of milk and live cultures, healthy bacteria that both turn milk into yogurt and help with digestion. Because of this, yogurt is packed full of health benefits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Benefits:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Bone Health<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Yogurt is made from milk, so it is naturally a good source of calcium. This is the building block for our bones, and yogurt contains high levels of it. With a single serving (8 oz.) of yogurt, you get about 40% of your daily calcium needs. (This number is slightly less with Greek yogurts.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Digestion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">As mentioned before, milk is turned into yogurt with the addition of live, active cultures. Essentially healthy bacteria, these probiotics promote a healthy digestive system. Eating yogurt on a daily basis is known to keep one regular.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Protein<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Yogurt is a wonderful, natural source of protein. With anywhere from 12-20 grams of protein per 8 oz. serving (more in Greek), yogurt is certainly a protein rich snack. This is good if you&rsquo;re on a diet, as it makes the body feel full longer. It also means that yogurt is a good choice for after working out.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Heart Health<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In people who have yogurt about twice every week (the equivalent to 2% or more of one&rsquo;s daily caloric intake), studies have shown a reduced risk of developing high blood pressure. It is important to have low-fat yogurt if you&rsquo;re worried about your blood pressure, though, as dairy fat can increase the bad cholesterol in your system and worsen your condition.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Additional Nutrients<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">In addition to the nutrients and benefits already discussed, yogurt also contains minerals like potassium and magnesium, as well as vitamin B.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/why-you-should-keep-yogurt-in-your-diet.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Yogurt is more than just \"part of a complete breakfast\" or a fun, no-hassle dessert.

Even artificial sweeteners aren&rsquo;t a healthy alternative. In recent years, however, a natural herb-based sweetener called stevia has been becoming more and more commonplace.<\/p>\n<p>A plant native to South America, <em>Stevia rebaudiana<\/em>, or just simply &ldquo;stevia,&rdquo; is around 200 times sweeter than common table sugar, sucrose. That is not the only benefit of the herb, though. In this article, we examine the other qualities of this zero-calorie plant-based sweetener and discuss the varieties available on the market today.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>From Leaf to Table<\/h3>\n<p>There are a variety of manufacturers of stevia products that all create slightly different substances. Good &amp; Sweet, PureVia, Reb A, SweetLeaf Stevia Sweetener, and Truvia all make a product that somewhat resembles table sugar by reducing and crystallizing the sugar in the leaf. Sun Crystals is kind of the &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; stevia, combining common table sugar with the plant-based sweetener. Finally, if you want the truly all-natural experience, many garden centers sell the herb itself, which you can plant in the ground in warm climates, or keep potted and take inside for northern winters. With fresh stevia leaves, you can naturally sweeten iced tea or other beverages and a variety of&nbsp;foods, including baked goods.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Benefits<\/h3>\n<p>The reasons for choosing stevia over other no-calorie sweeteners go on and on. Other sweeteners could cause health risks; Aspartame is thought to be related to the development of cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma, and Saccharide is linked to the development of bladder cancer. In addition, from a taste standpoint these fake sugars are not equitable to normal sugar. On the other hand, stevia is considered safe by medical officials and has no adverse tastes. In fact, certain stevia products can be as much as 200 times sweeter than sugar, so you don&rsquo;t have to use as much of this calorie-free sweetener.<br \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Conversion<\/h3>\n<p>The official website for stevia provides us with this <a title=\"Stevia Table\" href=\"http:\/\/www.stevia.net\/conversion.html\" target=\"_blank\">table<\/a>&nbsp;for easy baking conversions.

Potassium is an essential mineral nutrient that is found naturally in many foods, and an important part of keeping your body functioning healthily.<\/p>\n<p>We know that we should be on the lookout for certain minerals in our foods.

Deficiency of potassium in the system can take a serious toll on the whole system. If one is lacking in proper levels, they may suffer from fatigue, irritability, and hypertension. With optimal amounts of potassium in the system, the body not only functions properly and feels good, but the risk for hypertension is also reduced.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are a wide variety of sources of potassium in common dietary components. What&rsquo;s more, it is practically impossible to take in too much potassium from natural sources, unless you are on dialysis. Taking too much potassium from supplements like potassium salts can also cause nausea, vomiting, and heart failure in extreme situations.<\/p>\n<p>Common sources of potassium include most vegetables, dried apricots, plain yogurt, fish (especially salmon), avocados, and bananas. The vegetables with the highest levels of potassium are beans, spinach, chard, kale, potatoes, and acorn squash.

Before turning to complex diet techniques and popular products, however, it's best to first get down the basics. There's one substance that most Americans don't get enough of, but that helps in pretty much every area of health concern, from weight loss to skin health, and is essential to normal bodily functions like walking and thinking.<\/p>\n<p>Every day you lose water when you exercise, perspire - even when you breathe. For your body to function properly, you must be sure to replenish your water supply by consuming fluids throughout the day. You may have heard the popular piece of advice: drink 8 eight-once glasses of water per day. In fact, the Institute for Medicine recommends 10-12 eight-ounce glasses of water per day. And you'll want to drink more on days that you exercise: have a few more cups before, during, and after your workout.<\/p>\n<p>You may already be familiar with the reasons why you need water. If not, here's a refresher. Your body is actually 72% water. Your brain is over 75% water, your blood is 80% water, and your liver is a whopping 96% water. Water helps regulate body temperature, reduce headaches and fatigue, lubricate your joints, flush out toxins, relieve asthma, improve skin complexion... the list really does go on and on. There's just no substitute for drinking copious amounts of water. And best of all - it's pretty much free. Even bottled water is cheaper than most other beverages.<\/p>\n<p>Still, most people don't drink enough water. People are busy so much of the day that they often overlook drinking water. I wish I could give you a list of 20 things to do to fix this, but really there's only one - and it's cheap and easy. Just carry around a water bottle. You probably already have one lying around. Fill it up in the morning, sip it throughout the day, and fill it up when it runs out. Within the first day, you'll feel an increase in energy and productivity. Not only will you <em>feel<\/em> healthier, you'll actually <em>be<\/em> healthier.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/nfmwebappassets\/articlesContents\/Diet\/water_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"95%\" \/><\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/water.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Before turning to complex diet techniques and popular products, however, it's best to first get down the basics.","date_published":"2014-04-20 14:41:00","published":"1","seo_url":"why-you-need-more-water.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"61045","author":"172"},{"id":"407","name":"5 Fruits for Better Health","body":"<p>Summer is fast approaching, which means that a wide array of healthy fruits are coming into season. This is great news for the health-obsessed. If there's one thing dietitians all agree on, it's that you can't have too much fruit. Even low carb diets make a special exception for fruit because fruits help in every area of nutrition: they're packed with vitamins and nutrients and they're generally low calorie, so they help with weight loss too.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we identify 5 fruits that are coming into season that would be great additions to your diet. Plus, for each one, we have a great recipe to help you incorporate it.<\/p>\n<h4>Avocados<\/h4>\n<p>We already covered the health benefits of avocados in <a href=\"http:\/\/dietanalytics.com\/articles\/everyone-should-eat-avocados.html\/\">this article<\/a>. To summarize, we think too many people shy away from avocados because they're relatively high calorie. In reality, avocados are an ideal diet staple for two reasons: (1) they're loaded with nutrients and healthy fats; (2) they taste good, which means you won't hate eating them like you might other diet foods.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Easy Avocado Fries\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/HtnyIJdmf4fbRNl-VjxUW2Q0AhF_MuYiUAHWl0eUq29qTPLWO0e-vGT1iG_X4i8O6ZpnFtoXRj9Cu1ahkk7Xaw=s730\" alt=\"Easy Avocado Fries\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Easy avocado fries:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yummly.com\/recipe\/external\/Easy-Avocado-Fries-511102\">see the full recipe here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I know what you're thinking: deep frying is unhealthy!

They are not high in protein, they don't contain many vitamins or minerals, and they aren't a fruit or a vegetable. Many people mistakenly conclude from this that mushrooms aren't really very healthy. This is myth #1. In fact, mushrooms should be an integral component of any person's diet.<\/p>\n<p>When I make some type of food a staple of my diet, I have two criteria. First, it must have high nutritional value. As we will see, mushrooms have myriad health benefits and easily meet this condition. And second, it must taste good. I don't add things to my diet that I have to force down. This is a recipe for disaster. If you hate your diet, you'll start with a few \"cheat meals\" and very soon abandon it altogether.<\/p>\n<p>For me at least, mushrooms meet this second condition as well. There are so many types of mushrooms to choose from and so many different ways to incorporate them into your diet. Not only will they make your diet more healthful, they'll also make it easier to follow. Here we'll focus on shiitake mushrooms, their benefits and ways to include them in your diet.<\/p>\n<h4>Health Benefits<\/h4>\n<p>Shiitake mushrooms have two major health impacts: immune support and cardiovascular benefits.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Immune support.<\/strong> The impact of shiitake mushrooms on the immune system are astounding, almost magical. Some studies have shown that shiitake mushrooms prevent excessive immune system activity; others have shown that they increase immune system activity. Although these results appear contradictory, really they illustrate the power of these mushrooms. They shut down the immune system when it's not needed and would waste energy, and rev it up when it is needed. In this way, shiitake mushrooms provide customized support for our immune system under all circumstances.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cardiovascular benefits.<\/strong> Another impact of shiitake mushrooms is on our cardiovascular systems. A significant amount of research has documented their ability to lower cholesterol and provide antioxidant support which helps unclog arteries.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Selection, Storage, and Preparation<\/h4>\n<p>Many grocery stores and supermarkets carry shiitake mushrooms. If yours doesn't, look for an Asian food store - they almost always carry shiitake and other specialty mushrooms. The best shiitake mushrooms will be firm; avoid wrinkly mushrooms. Make sure that the store you buy them from cleans them. Shiitake mushrooms will keep for about a week if you refrigerate them in a paper bag. Dried mushrooms will keep for up to a year. As noted above, there are many ways to prepare mushrooms and we can't even scratch the surface here. You could prepare mushrooms a different way every day for the rest of your life.

You may be surprised to find out, however, that the more nutritious option is often times frozen.<\/p>\n<p>This article explains how to make the right choice between fresh and frozen produce. We also give you some tips and suggestions for using frozen produce in ways that you may not have ever considered.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>&ldquo;Fresh&rdquo; or something else?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>The problem with fresh produce is that its name is misleading. When you think of something as being &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; it is likely you think &ldquo;new&rdquo; or &ldquo;ripe,&rdquo; but this is only really the case with certain local crops when they are in season. For the rest of the year, and for crops grown far away year-round, &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; is anything but what you think it is. Because of the impossibility of growing many foods near the store, the majority of produce is shipped in from far away.<\/p>\n<p>To make shipping produce possible, it must be picked well before it is ripe. This ensures that it won&rsquo;t spoil in transit, however it has many negative implications. Primarily, it is the last stages of a fruit or vegetable&rsquo;s growth that are the most formative for its development of flavor and nutritional worth. By picking produce prior to the time it is ready, it never reaches its full potential.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Frozen Food&rsquo;s Unfortunate Reputation<\/h3>\n<p>Frozen produce, on the other hand, is picked at its prime then quickly frozen. This means that the fruit or vegetable has been allowed to reach perfection in both flavor and nutrient content. All of this goodness is then locked in through the process of freezing, so that it can be shipped to you without spoiling.<\/p>\n<p>Of course a very local, freshly picked fruit or veggie provides you with the best produce experience, but for most of the year, depending on where you live, this is usually not possible. Because of this, frozen produce really can be your best bet.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Recipes:&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<h4>Chicken Pot Pie<\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Chicken Pot Pie\" href=\"http:\/\/allrecipes.com\/Recipe\/Chicken-Pot-Pie-IX\/Detail.aspx?evt19=1\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http:\/\/images.media-allrecipes.com\/userphotos\/250x250\/00\/14\/23\/142350.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Pot Pie\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not using them to ice a wound, throw a package of frozen peas, carrots, or mixed veggies into a <a title=\"Chicken Pot Pie Recipe\" href=\"http:\/\/allrecipes.com\/Recipe\/Chicken-Pot-Pie-IX\/Detail.aspx?evt19=1\" target=\"_blank\">chicken pot pie<\/a>.

Their rich array of vitamins decreases circulating fats and cholesterol levels, among other things.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">3. <strong>Blood sugar levels.<\/strong> New studies reveal that strawberry consumption is linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, strawberries have a moderating effect on blood sugar levels. In a recent study, subjects consumed either sugar or strawberries with sugar. The group that consumed only sugar experienced a sharp spike in blood sugar levels, while the group that consumed both saw just a moderate increase.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">4. <strong>Cancer prevention.<\/strong> The phytonutrients in strawberries have been shown to reduce the risk of breast, cervical, colon, and esophageal cancer.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">5. <strong>Weight loss.<\/strong> The anthocyanins in strawberries lead the body to burn stored fat at a faster rate. In addition, strawberries are very low in calories at just 54 calories in a cup. This makes strawberries a great snack for anyone trying to lose weight.<\/p>\n<h4>Selection, Storage, and Preparation<\/h4>\n<p>One of the only downsides to strawberries is how perishable they are. Purchase your strawberries within a few days of consumption. Note, though, that they do not ripen once picked, so be sure you choose strawberries that are already ripe: look for a deep red color and attached green caps. Ripe berries not only taste better, but also have more nutrients. Strawberries will keep in a refrigerator for about two days. After this time span, they lose both nutrient content and taste. Freezing strawberries is always a good option.<\/p>\n<p>As the weather gets warmer, there's no better food to add to your diet than the sweet, refreshing, and healthy strawberry. Remember that strawberries are most nutritious when enjoyed fresh, uncooked. Here are two great ways to incorporate fresh strawberries into your diet.<\/p>\n<h4>Fresh Strawberry and Raspberry Lemonade <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">by <a href=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/chef\/Mary-Poehnelt\/\">Mary Poehnelt<\/a><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Fresh Lemonade\" src=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/assets\/contentsFiles\/images\/recipe\/Fresh-Strawberry_and_Raspberry_Lemonade_Thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Fresh Lemonade\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>Mary Poehnelt, the Butcher from Belchertown and runner-up on FOX's hit show <em>Hell's Kitchen<\/em>, gives lemonade a twist with an infusion of berries and honey.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/recipes\/fresh-strawberry-and-raspberry-lemonade.html\">See full recipe here.<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Strawberry Jalapeno Salsa <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barefeetinthekitchen.com\/\">Barefeet in the Kitchen<\/a><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Strawberry Jalapeno Salsa\" src=\"http:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/L_L-xwYUWv4BXIS0oV67rJrqIbdctl2JxEcUvXfZTuGAhMPWr_EwRlt_DwL_kWe5IWewE6rXKCBVMiFJZovR5Q=s730\" alt=\"Strawberry Jalapeno Salsa\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>Sweet berries, spicy jalapenos, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of lime combine to make this an unforgettable salsa.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.yummly.com\/recipe\/external\/Strawberry-Jalapeno-Salsa-486963\">See full recipe here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/onigiri_chang\/8728111350\/in\/photolist-eigRqs-7pJKaU-85PsMA-7Jqp1n-m4vsDj-8adzHw-nd5CJS-D2JNx-bygtq9-6BgmAC-6cBSWS-a3oouQ-3e2qty-ETXAw-DXMLP-bBBym4-bSsVf-6FQTpw-82Sph2-8htK3S-82VNEW-cMmxZy-82Vyhu-8htHqd-8hqmYk-82VycW-MKr76-4Q5L6g-bMB6Rg-a43tw7-i5REx-NHyYo-avH5Jz-5hrND8-6y51pC-fBAmmq-82Vy85-82SE74-fhs27X-4TBmGG-ciZ5Jd-7U4BxR-4TxbrZ-66AMWN-8fYvMV-hSAMna-7TT1Xh-4DW1jj-99B4GW-avafWR\">Photo<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/onigiri_chang\/\">Hiroyuki Takeda<\/a> on Flickr. <a href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nd\/2.0\/\">Some rights reserved.<\/a><\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/strawberries.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"In this article, we discuss the health benefits of strawberries in detail and give a few awesome recipes to help you enjoy strawberries the right way!","date_published":"2014-05-05 11:16:50","published":"1","seo_url":"strawberries-the-next-superfood.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"56254","author":"172"},{"id":"391","name":"An Introduction to Intermittent Fasting","body":"<p>Two common-sense principles have long dominated the diet conversation: (1) always eat breakfast and (2) eat many small meals spaced evenly throughout the day. The justifications for these two facts are related. Eating breakfast is said to \"kickstart your metabolism\", which will help you burn more calories; and it may prevent you from overeating in other meals. Similarly, eating many small meals - up to 6 - per day will ensure that your metabolism roars throughout the day and helps with portion control.<\/p>\n<p>A new diet pattern called <em>intermittent fasting<\/em> is challenging this conventional wisdom. Intermittent fasting is not really a diet since it does not tell you <em>what<\/em> to eat, but rather <em>when<\/em> to eat. And it stands as an alternative to the two views above.<\/p>\n<h4>Background<\/h4>\n<p>Intermittent fasting is a diet plan that incorporates intentionally skipping meals. This means you'll get calories only during specific, controlled times of day. One popular method of intermittent fasting is the following: <strong>Regularly eat only during a set time period like 2-9PM; have lunch at 2, some snacks, and dinner around 8PM.<\/strong> A more intense version would reduce the eating interval from 7 hours (2-9PM) down to 6 or even 4 hours. This is a variable that you will have to adjust based on results and what you feel you can sustain.<\/p>\n<h4>How does it work?<\/h4>\n<p>The effect of intermittent fasting is best described by first describing the effects of eating several small meals throughout the day. In this latter plan, your body constantly has energy (from food) to fuel its everyday activities: walking to work, working out, etc. However, with intermittent fasting, there is a long period of the day where your body does not get energy from food. So it must rely on fat stores in your body for energy. Thus, every time you perform an activity, you're burning body fat.<\/p>\n<h4>Drawbacks<\/h4>\n<p>Although intermittent fasting can be highly effective as a weight loss tool, it does have its drawbacks. Going without food for extended periods of time can, predictably, lead to fatigue and feelings of hunger. But any weight loss diet should lead to fatigue, since only in a fatigued state will your body start burning body fat for energy. However, this effect is much more pronounced when you start intermittent fasting. You'll get used to it. For this reason, we recommend gradually adjusting your eating patterns to an intermittent fasting schedule. For example, try pushing your first meal back 30 minutes per day for a week or two.<\/p>\n<h4>Health Considerations<\/h4>\n<p>As with any major change to your diet, you should consult a physician prior to starting the plan. This is especially true with a plan like intermittent fasting, and is absolutely necessary if you have issues managing blood sugar, cholesterol, or diabetes.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/fasting.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"A new diet pattern called intermittent fasting is challenging this conventional wisdom.

Consuming green vegetables is excellent for boosting certain vitamins such as A, C, K, and E (and minerals such as beta-carotene, folate, and potassium). But, you risk weakening your teeth by drinking your food daily rather than chewing it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Reasons for Drinking Green Smoothies<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Swallowing difficulties (termed <em>dysphasia<\/em>) make eating problematic for people who have had esophageal cancer or strictures, and the elderly&mdash;as well as due to surgery or radiation therapy. This can easily lead to nutritional deficiencies.&nbsp; Using a straw to drink liquefied foods is recommended in these cases by the website of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cancer.net\/navigating-cancer-care\/side-effects\/difficulty-swallowing-or-dysphagia\"><em>Cancer.net<\/em><\/a>. Vitamin C is necessary for healthy gums, repair and maintenance of cartilage, and in the formation of a protein to make blood vessels.&nbsp; Green vegetables (particularly spinach and broccoli) are high in Vitamin C.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Many children are allergic to citrus fruits such as oranges. For these children, a green smoothie can be a healthy breakfast alternative to orange juice. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/ods.od.nih.gov\/factsheets\/VitaminC-HealthProfessional\/#h3\"><em>National Institutes of Health<\/em><\/a>, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C for children aged 4-8 years old is 25 mg; from 9-13 years old, the RDA is 45 mg.&nbsp; One-half cup of raw broccoli (44 gm) provides 39.2 mg of Vitamin C (according to the website of <a href=\"http:\/\/nutritiondata.self.com\/facts\/vegetables-and-vegetable-products\/2356\/2\"><em>SelfNutritionData<\/em><\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>'Fad' Diets and Green Smoothies<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Motivational speakers have advocated green smoothies as a weight loss tool.&nbsp; While drinking green smoothies can increase consumption of vitamins and minerals, no medical evidence has shown drinking such a concoction promotes weight loss. The feeling of fullness (satiety) is decreased by drinking foods versus consuming them in solid form (per an article in 2012 in the <a href=\"http:\/\/jn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2012\/05\/02\/jn.111.149583.full.pdf\"><em>Journal of Nutrition<\/em><\/a>). Therefore, drinking green smoothies may actually promote weight gain instead of weight loss.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Increasing exercise in combination with decreased calorie intake is the most successful method to lose weight. This is because exercise burns calories, and increases metabolic rate. For individuals who are obese, close monitoring by a clinical nutritionist is the most recommended method for embarking on a healthy weight loss program.&nbsp; Since the loss of approximately 3,500 calories is necessary to lose one pound of weight, eating a lower calorie diet in tandem with burning calories is more effective than either 'calorie-cutting' or exercise alone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>The Value of a Nutritionist in Designing a Weight Loss Plan<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Individuals embarking on weight loss diets need to balance their intake of nutrients. Daily meal plans need to incorporate enough water-soluble vitamins and minerals so that deficiencies do not result.&nbsp; People with diabetes, high cholesterol levels, kidney disease, and food allergies who need to lose weight may require the input of a clinical nutritionist for appropriate meal-planning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Many smokers experience weight gain on cessation of cigarette smoking.&nbsp; This can result in their relapse to smoking due to emotional distress at gaining weight.&nbsp; For this reason, a consultation with a clinical nutritionist can promote &ldquo;quitting&rdquo; cigarettes in overweight people enrolled in smoking cessation programs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Pregnant women who are obese are at high risk for developing gestational diabetes or eclampsia&mdash;both of which are dangerous complications of pregnancy.

It plays an essential role in our bodies and over 50% of Americans have a magnesium deficiency according to the US Department of Agriculture. The good news is that it's very easy to get more magnesium and, since magnesium plays a large role in energy production, you'll likely feel much healthier and more energetic as a result.<\/p>\n<h4>Health Benefits<\/h4>\n<p>Magnesium is necessary for over 300 chemical reactions in the human body. And these are just the ones we know about. Researchers discover more every year. Magnesium plays three key roles in your body's processes.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Improves Bone Health.<\/strong> Calcium gets all the fame for this important function, but magnesium is a key contributor as well. Magnesium deficiency has been shown to be a key contributor to bone loss.<br \/><br \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Contributes to Energy Production.<\/strong> You may have learned about energy production (called cellular respiration) in school. You also may have not wanted to learn about it very much because it's such a complex process. Respiration consists of many reactions, some of which require magnesium to occur. This is why magnesium deficiency can cause fatigue.<br \/><br \/><\/li>\n<li><strong>Controls Blood Sugar Levels.<\/strong> Similar to respiration, there are many reactions that need to occur to stabilize blood sugar levels in the human body. However, many of these reactions can't occur without magnesium. Research has shown that magnesium deficiency can reduce blood sugar control and that this issue can be improved by consuming more magnesium.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>How To Get More<\/h4>\n<p>So now you've decided that you're definitely going to start getting more magnesium, but how do you do it? As with many minerals, your best bet is green vegetables. If you want your diet to contain enough magnesium, but don't want to constantly think about where to get more, just eat veggies like spinach, swiss chard, kale, and green beans. Many grains are also rich in magneisum: barley, brown rice, buckwheat, millet, and quinoa.<\/p>\n<h4>Warm Spinach Salad<\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Warm Spinach Salad\" src=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/assets\/contentsFiles\/images\/recipe\/warm-spinach-salad.jpg\" alt=\"Warm Spinach Salad\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil<\/li>\n<li>2 tablespoons crushed garlic<\/li>\n<li>1\/2 cup plain almonds<\/li>\n<li>1\/2 cup sun dried cranberries<\/li>\n<li>3 roman tomatoes<\/li>\n<li>1 cup Balsamic vinaigrette<\/li>\n<li>1 package baby spinach<\/li>\n<li>1 cup goat cheese<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/recipes\/warm-spinach-salad.html\">See full recipe here.<\/a><\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/magnesium.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Learn why more magnesium might be exactly what you need and how to incorporate more into your diet.

Whether it is added to the milk you're drinking or you hear about getting it from being out in the sun, vitamin D seems to have made its way into every part of our lives. But what is vitamin D, anyway?<\/p>\n<h4>Health Benefits<\/h4>\n<p>Found naturally in many of the foods we eat, vitamin D is a nutrient that is crucial in many of the body's functions. Most notably, vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, the building block for bones. In this way vitamin D prevents conditions characterized by weakening of the bones, such as Rickets in children as well as osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults.<\/p>\n<p>Besides its overwhelming benefits to bone health, vitamin D also is helpful in making your muscles move and it bolsters your immune system. It is also instrumental to the nervous system, giving your nerves the ability to carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body. Surely vitamin D is a necessary nutrient to keep our bodies working the way we need them to.<\/p>\n<h4>Sources of Vitamin D<\/h4>\n<p><em>Can you get enough vitamin D from the sun alone?<\/em> Everyone always seems to ask him or herself this question, and the answer is never very clear. Simply put, the answer is \"no.\" While it is true that exposure to the sun causes the body to produce vitamin D, there are a variety of factors that prevent you from getting the needed amount from sun alone. First and foremost, your body cannot create vitamin D from indirect contact with the sun, such as through a car window or at your sunny desk. Also, as you age, it becomes more difficult for the body to make vitamin D from coming in contact with the sun. What's more, extended stays in the sun may increase the production of vitamin D, but such unprotected exposure to the sun's rays puts you in great risk for skin cancer.<\/p>\n<p>So, while certainly a portion of your body's vitamin D can be made from spending time outdoors in the sun, it is necessary to have a diet rich in vitamin D as well in order to support healthy levels of the nutrient. Foods that have higher levels of vitamin D include fatty fish, beef liver, mushrooms, and fortified milk and cereal.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/Vitamin_D.jpg","image_url_small":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/Vitamin_D.jpg","meta_description":"It's hard to avoid seeing or hearing something about vitamin D these days.

But, pesticide use, lack of crop rotation, and commercial fertilizer applications foster a potential environmental disaster in the United States. Corn grown specifically as animal feed is contributing to lower quality beef products - not to mention the public health effects of antibiotic-injected cattle and other animals. &nbsp;Switching to a 'green' diet can not only improve your health but also encourage sustainable and eco-friendly food production.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Agribusiness and Choosing a 'Green' Diet<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Agribusiness aims to maximize profitability for its shareholders. One cost containment method is to produce plant-based and meat products as cheaply as possible. Likewise, agribusiness extensively utilizes pesticides to kill insects and weeds. Many of these pesticides&nbsp;are recognized as carcinogenic (and harmful to the central nervous and endocrine systems). The choice to embrace a 'green' diet that supports sustainable agriculture typically involves a change in grocery shopping and eating habits.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One strategy for switching to a 'green' diet is adhering to a vegetarian diet. Another is purchasing solely organic produce and meat. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.qai-inc.com\/about\/usda_nop.asp\"><em>Quality Assurance International<\/em><\/a>, a product is only certified (with a USDA-approved label) as organic if it meets the requirements of the <em>Organics Food Production Act<\/em> of 1990. The main health advantage of eating USDA-certified organic vegetables and fruit is that these contain fewer pesticides and were not grown in petroleum-based fertilizers - and animals bound for market (<em>e.g.,<\/em> chickens, cows, pigs, and goats) are not injected with antibiotics and growth hormones.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>'Green' Diets and Grocery-Shopping Options<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Shopping at Farmer's Markets and local food co-ops support sustainable agriculture and family farms (according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sustainabletable.org\/566\/where-can-you-find-sustainable-food\"><em>Grace Communications Foundation<\/em><\/a>). Purchasing food locally also increases the likelihood of freshness, as nutrients diminish within one week of being picked. Corporation-owned ranches often ship animals long distances to slaughter production facilities, in contrast to the locally-raised meat of family farms. The long-distance transport of pigs to slaughter-houses causes them measurable physical stress, resulting in increased hormone and enzyme secretion that adversely affects meat quality (per an article in 2012 in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.veterinaryworld.org\/Vol.5\/March%202012\/Relationship%20of%20transport%20distance,%20sex%20on%20live%20weight%20loss%20of%20pigs%20during%20transit%20to%20slaughter%20house.pdf\"><em>Veterinary World<\/em><\/a>).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>'Green' Diets as a Response to Pollution<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Foods shipped long-distance by airplane and truck not only result in poor nutritional quality, but increase air pollution levels (due to diesel and gasoline fuel emissions).

Despite its popularity, though, couscous is no ordinary food fad. Full of nutrients, couscous offers numerous health benefits. In addition, it is the qualities that couscous doesn&rsquo;t have that make it outshine other similar dishes, such as rice and quinoa.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to get in on all of the hype, or just want a healthier option to fill out your plate, couscous may be for you. Not only is couscous high in protein, potassium, and antioxidants like selenium, it is also low in calories and fat when compared to alternative side dishes. This article goes further into couscous&rsquo; nutritional content, health benefits, and how it can be used in your cooking.<\/p>\n<p><br \/><strong>Nutrients &amp; Benefits<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Couscous is technically fine pasta, made from granules of semolina flour. Because of this, it is a relatively good source of non-red-meat protein (12% of your daily needs in one serving). In addition, it notably contains 61% of the recommended daily value of an antioxidant called selenium and 39% of the recommended potassium.<\/p>\n<p>These nutrients all contribute to a better-working overall system in their own ways.

The amount of energy you are physically capable of exerting will be affected by the food intake that occurred beforehand. The conversion of food into glucose at a cellular level is essential to avoid muscle fatigue and exhaustion - but many diets for weight loss emphasize meal plans that are incompatible with your workout. It is essential to understand the role of protein, carbohydrates, and fats to adjust your eating to produce the right amount of glucose.<\/p>\n<h4>High Protein Diets Won't Cut It<\/h4>\n<p>Protein is associated with cellular regeneration and healthy muscles. However, cellular energy is produced when carbohydrates (changed into glucose) are chemically converted to energy during a biochemical process called the \"Krebs cycle\". Protein is not utilized for energy until the other two nutrient building blocks - carbohydrates and fats - have been depleted. For people on diets to lose weight, reducing carbohydrates can be important to decreasing daily calorie consumption. Protein-rich foods tend to be lower in calories and energy, but individuals engaged in intensive exercise routines need carbohydrates to keep up their energy level. Otherwise, the result can be faster muscle fatigue and energy depletion during a high-intensity workout.<\/p>\n<h4>Emphasize Cereal and Whole Grains<\/h4>\n<p>The reason many marathon runners and long-distance bicyclists eat an energy bar a half-hour before commencing is that complex carbohydrates (e.g., grains) are the best source of fuel for muscles. Sugar (as found in candy) is metabolized into glucose in a different manner than cereal and grains - and produces \"quick\" energy that vanishes just as quickly. Energy bars are usually composed of a combination of carbohydrates and proteins. Therefore, they have a high nutritional value for people engaged in high-intensity exercise. Eating whole grain bread is also an excellent source of complex carbohydrates (and, therefore, often included in meals by people who are not dieting and maintain an exercise routine).<\/p>\n<p>For overweight individuals attempting to diet, daily exercise can promote weight loss as calories are burned up by aerobic exercise. However, reducing calorie consumption is the most effective way to lose weight, as the amount of exercise necessary to burn calories is often more than the dieter can perform on a daily basis. Additionally, eating an energy bar will put on calories in a person not undergoing exercise since this is a high-caloric snack!<\/p>\n<h4>Dealing with Hunger after a Workout<\/h4>\n<p>Following an hour of vigorous exercise, a person can often feel hungry in response to depleted blood glucose and fatigue. It is not a good idea to over-eat after intensive exercise. Digesting food requires energy - and the energy depletion may not enable proper digestion of large amounts of food consumed at one time. This can result in stomach cramps. It is best to eat a small amount of protein. This will help the tissues replenish, and provide enough energy to allow a return to normal heart rate before consuming a meal.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/what-to-eat-before-workout.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Dietary intake before exercise needs to match your physiological needs.

People these days take pills that are intended to perform a variety of functions, from promoting healthy heart function to sharpening memory. For many, a daily multivitamin can make us feel free to eat whatever we want, leaving vitamins to take care of any nutrients we don't get from our diets.<\/p>\n<p>There is a lot of controversy over whether or not multivitamins actually have these health benefits for people taking them, but here we will focus on a different question: Do multivitamins even contain what they say they do?<\/p>\n<p>As it turns out, for one third of all multivitamins, the answer is that it does not. Unlike medicine, multivitamins aren't strictly regulated by the FDA. Mis-labelled multivitamins are less effective at the very least, but they can sometimes even be dangerous.<\/p>\n<p>Some multivitamins do not properly release the ingredients they contain. If the tablets are not digested, they do not deliver the full amount of nutrients that they contain.<\/p>\n<p>Other supplements contained either too little or too much of several essential vitamins.<\/p>\n<p>Vitamin A and folic acid are two basic vitamins that many supplements either contained too much or too little of. Several of the multivitamins tested contained much less of these nutrients than reported on labels: some as low as 46%; some didn't even have any!<\/p>\n<p>It's actually far more worrisome if a multivitamin contains more than its reported amount of something, since too much of any particular vitamin can have harmful effects. Too much Vitamin A, for example, is toxic to the liver and can cause bone weakening. Certain multivitamin brands for children contain amounts of Vitamin A that far exceed recommended levels.<\/p>\n<p>Most iodine supplements contain much less iodine than they're supposed to. A study of 60 multivitamins shows that only 28% contain the amount on the label. This may put newborns whose mothers are on iodine supplements at risk of developmental delays, since iodine deficiency can lead to mental retardation.<\/p>\n<p>Some multivitamins even contain amounts of lead that are more than 10 times the amount permitted without a warning label in certain states. Although this amount of lead is not immediately toxic to adults, it can accumulate in the body. Such supplements should definitely not be given to children, who are highly susceptible to lead poisoning.<\/p>\n<p><br \/><br \/><\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/your-multi.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Do multivitamins even contain what they say they do?","date_published":"2013-12-09 00:00:00","published":"1","seo_url":"your-multivitamin.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"50664","author":"172"},{"id":"358","name":"Prepared Meals: Think Outside the Freezer","body":"<p>If you're looking for a way to save time on meal preparation and dial in your diet at the same time, you might want to look into the emerging trend of prepared meal delivery services. After a long day of work, we all crave a warm, nutritious meal - and preferably NOT the one pictured above. Most people either cook their own meals or eat prepackaged frozen food. With a prepared meal service, you can get the best of both worlds: delicious, healthy food and low prep time. Here are 3 big reasons to consider prepared meal services.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Quality<\/h4>\n<p>Of course, when it comes to food, quality is number 1. Most prepared meal services feature recipes designed by award-winning chefs. Furthermore, because these services are provided to so many people, they can offer great variety. Many services boast dozens of unique, delicious recipes.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Individualization<\/h4>\n<p>Prepared meal programs offer individualized diet plans. These diets are planned by professional dietitians to a degree that the average working person cannot. This means that every meal can be finely tuned to your goals: everything from the balance of carbs, proteins, and fats to the amount of vitamins and minerals to portion size. In addition, if you're vegan or gluten-free or have any other dietary restrictions, don't worry because many prepared meal services can take into account these restrictions. Or if you plain don't like an item on the menu, you can easily remove it.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Convenience<\/h4>\n<p>Finally, prepared meal services offer great convenience. They take care of shopping and cooking for you, and they make cleaning up a breeze! You'll receive a week's worth of meals on Sunday, stick them in your fridge or freezer, and heat them up when you're ready to eat.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, you're probably wondering how much these services cost. The leading prepared meal providers cost between $150 and $200 per week, which slightly exceeds the amount most Americans spend on groceries each week. However, if you often find yourself strapped for time, the convenience of prepared meal services might make up the difference.

Have you ever heard people talk about your organs or nervous system sending &quot;signals&quot; to your brain? These are electrical signals. <em>Electrolytes<\/em> (which is just a fancy name for salts) help conduct and regulate the electrical charges in your body. This is one reason why it&#39;s so important to replenish your electrolytes post-workout. Potassium is an electrolyte that helps your body perform this task. Besides fulfilling its function as an electrolyte, though, potassium has many other important health benefits.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is why it&#39;s so shocking that 98% of Americans&#39; diets are deficient in potassium. One reason for this is that Americans aren&#39;t aware of the health benefits. Another is that most people have no idea what foods actually contain potassium.<\/p>\n\n<p>As mentioned, potassium has numerous health benefits. Besides the role it plays as an electrolyte, here are a few other benefits of a diet high in potassium:<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Potassium can improve blood pressure control. The DASH diet, ranked best diet by US News &amp; World, was originally designed to prevent hypertension, and features many potassium-rich foods.<\/li>\n\t<li>By keeping your blood pressure under control, you also work to improve kidney health. Furthermore, potassium reduces the risk of having kidney stones. Anyone who&#39;s had a kidney stone knows that this is reason enough to consume more potassium.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Now you&#39;re probably excited to start getting more potassium into your diet, but you still don&#39;t know how to. Maybe the one food that people associate with potassium is the banana. You may have heard the recommendation to eat bananas around workout time. They&#39;ll not only provide a quick burst of energy - they&#39;ll also replenish electrolytes like potassium. Bananas are a good start, but there are many other foods that are more densely-packed with potassium. Generally, fruits and vegetables - especially leafy green vegetables - are very high in potassium. Some top common sources of potassium are: spinach, beets, broccoli, tomatoes, asparagus, carrots, kale, and lettuce.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>World&#39;s Healthiest Foods<\/em> ranked all the ingredients that are sources of potassium.

Berries are a rich source of polyphenols, a compound also found in cocoa, tea, and red wine. Since these foods have been shown to improve cardiovascular health, the authors of the study sought to find out if berries do too. The subjects were given a wide variety of berries, from bilberries and lingonberries to the more traditional strawberries. In just eight weeks of eating 2 servings of berries per day, the subjects saw \"favorable changes\" in cholesterol levels and blood pressure.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this study only adds to an already long list of health benefits of berries. Here is a list of some common berries and their most important health benefits.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blueberries.<\/strong> Blueberries are now widely regarded as a \"superfood\". While this label may be an exaggeration, blueberries have well-documented cardiovascular and cognitive benefits due to their high levels of antioxidants. Routine blueberry intake has been shown in laboratory settings to reduce blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic), improve memory, and delay the effect of aging.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Strawberries.<\/strong> As confirmed by the NPHI study cited above, strawberries have been associated with prevention of cardiovascular disease and improvements in blood pressure.

We expect 2014 to be as well, and for good reason. Quinoa is easily prepared, has high nutritional value, and tastes great. Plus it's very easy to grow, which means it will play an important role in food security in developing countries. Quinoa has only started to gain popularity in the United States, but unlike other fads, this one should not be dismissed.<\/p>\n<h4>Health Benefits<\/h4>\n<p>Quinoa often plays the role of a carbohydrate in meals - as a substitute for bread, pasta, or rice. However, this is an unfair comparison to quinoa. In fact, its nutrient value far surpasses these other carbohydrate sources. Foods like bread, pasta, and rice might be considered \"empty calories\" or \"empty carbs\". They are rich in energy from carbohydrates, but do not contain many other nutrients. Quinoa stands in striking contrast. Unlike these other foods, quinoa is a complete protein source. This makes it especially valuable to vegetarians. Quinoa also contains healthy fats: oleic acid, which is a heart-healthy unsaturated fat, as well as omega-3, which has anti-inflammatory and pro-cognitive properties. So quinoa actually has a balanced macronutrient profile, unlike the carb-heavy side dishes like bread and rice.<\/p>\n<h4>Selecting, Storing, and Preparing<\/h4>\n<p>Due to its rising popularity, most supermarkets have quinoa. You should have no problem finding it. We recommend buying it in bulk. The bin it's in should be covered to ensure freshness. Make sure that the quinoa is 100% dry. Store quinoa in an airtight container. Plastic bags will rip easily and the last thing you want is a few hundred grains of quinoa scattered on your kitchen floor. Many people like to rinse their quinoa thoroughly before cooking it. This removes <em>saponins<\/em>, which are responsible for quinoa's bitter taste.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Preparation is a breeze. Simply mix 1 part grain, 2 parts water in a saucepan, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed. Here's a great recipe that uses quinoa in a very creative way.<\/p>\n<h4>Quinoa Salad<\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Quinoa Salad\" src=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/assets\/contentsFiles\/images\/recipe\/quinoa-salad.jpg\" alt=\"Quinoa Salad\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>This quinoa salad recipe gets its zest from the salad dressing, which is made out of lemons and limes, olive oil, and dijon mustard.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/recipes\/quinoa-salad.html\">See full recipe.<\/a><\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/quinoa.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"The Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN declared 2013 \"The International Year of Quinoa\".

Okay, that might be overstating it a little, but the facts remain: salmon has the protein content of beef, the nutrient profile of many vitamins, and a great taste. As for the school part, recent research even suggests that the omega-3 fatty acids present in salmon contribute to improved mood and cognitive abilities.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we discuss the health benefits of salmon in greater detail. Next, we give some advice on how to select and store your salmon. Finally, we have a few wonderful recipes so you can maximize your salmon experience!<\/p>\n<h4>The Health Benefits of Salmon<\/h4>\n<p>As noted above, the health benefits of salmon are wide-ranging and numerous. The list really does go on, and researches are constantly adding to it by discovering new benefits. Here are a few to start with:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Salmon has incredibly high omega-3 fatty acid content - one meal provides more omega-3s than most adults get in a few days. Omega-3s control inflammation, ease transfer of information between cells, improve cognitive function, and increase joint health.<\/li>\n<li>Increased consumption of salmon has linked to decreased risk of cardiovascular problems, including heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.<\/li>\n<li>Salmon is a great source of protein and hence is a must for anyone who exercises regularly - it's great for recovery after a tough workout.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you're still not convinced, I don't know what else I can say... well, eating salmon can improve eye health, decrease cancer risk, and... how are you not convinced yet?<\/p>\n<h4>How to Select and Store Your Salmon<\/h4>\n<p>You can buy salmon whole or as a steak or fillet; you can get it frozen, canned, dried, or smoked. Options abound. I recommend wild Alaskan salmon to be absolutely 100% sure you're avoiding any contamination concerns. If you opt for the whole salmon, make sure it has been buried in ice while on display. Have it scaled by a professional. You don't want to mutilate your salmon like I did the other night.<\/p>\n<p>As with other meats, smell is a good indicator of freshness. Although you should never leave salmon off for too long (you should be dying to cook it as soon as you make the purchase), if you think it might be bad, better safe than sorry. Your stomach and major organs will thank you. Keep in mind, however, that most refrigerators are slightly warmer than ideal for keeping fish. I recommend wrapping your fish up and storing it in a container or dish with ice. Replenish the ice once or twice per day. It will last about four days with this method.<\/p>\n<p>Here are two great recipes to try out with your fresh salmon:<\/p>\n<h4>Maple Cured Baked Salmon<\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Maple Cured Baked Salmon\" src=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/assets\/contentsFiles\/images\/recipe\/Maple_Baked_Salmon.jpg\" alt=\"Maple Cured Baked Salmon\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p><em>Ingredients:<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 whole salmon fillets<\/li>\n<li>3\/4 cup salt<\/li>\n<li>3\/4 cup maple syrup<\/li>\n<li>1\/4 teaspoon pepper<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Maple Cured Salmon Chowder<\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Maple Cured Baked Salmon\" src=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/assets\/contentsFiles\/images\/recipe\/Maple_Cured_Salmon_Chowder.jpg\" alt=\"Maple Cured Baked Salmon\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>This recipe uses the same maple cured baked salmon above.

It's also diabetic friendly, and great for weight loss and managing cholesterol. Have you heard of it?<\/p>\n<p>The DASH diet - short for \"Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension\" - was developed in the mid-1990s by Thomas Moore of the Boston University Medical Center. DASH is focused on cutting salt intake and increasing plant-based foods (e.g., fruits and vegetables) rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Unlike many fad diets, DASH has been clincically tested in a variety of settings.<\/p>\n<h4>High Blood Pressure and Heart Attack<\/h4>\n<p>Many people who have high blood pressure (hypertension) are unaware of their disorder, and therefore do not seek treatment. Often called \"the silent killer\", hypertension causes the arterial blood vessels to narrow and harden - which can lead to a heart attack. Hypertensive individuals are generally advised to lower sodium (or salt) consumption in foods as a high salt diet has been correlated to increased hypertension. Most packaged foods and frozen dinners available in grocery stores contain high amounts of sodium.<\/p>\n<h4>Relationship of Obesity to Hypertension<\/h4>\n<p>The risk of developing high blood pressure increases in obesity - and is occurring more often in adolescents in the United States. Along with one-third of all adults, 17% of youth are currently obese in the United States (according to an article published in 2014 in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association<\/em> [311(8):806-814]. Losing weight is associated with decreased hypertension in overweight persons, and promotion of the DASH diet is an obesity-prevention measure. Results of the <em>National Growth and Health Study<\/em> of more than 2,300 children showed that those who followed \"Dash-like\" diets were the least likely to become overweight in adolescence (which is a major predictor of obesity in adulthood).<\/p>\n<h4>The DASH Diet and Mediterranean Diet<\/h4>\n<p>Besides a high intake of vegetables, the DASH diet includes whole grains, nuts, fish, chicken, and low-fat dairy products. Like the Mediterranean diet, it limits intake of refined sugar and saturated fats. The difference between the DASH and Mediterranean diets is that the DASH diet plan includes more unsaturated fat that is considered supportive of HDL (good) cholesterol.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals who eat traditional American diets consume a high level of saturated fat in \"red meat\" and dairy products - which is linked to high LDL cholesterol levels in the bloodstream (as well as calories). A high caloric intake will produce weight gain in most people - and the empty calories found in snacks in elementary schools (which also have a high salt content) have resulted in a childhood obesity epidemic in the United States. Eating the healthy foods included in the DASH diet - and eliminating those food items <em>not<\/em> included in the DASH diet - can help children and teenagers remain within a normal weight range as well as promote healthier eating habits.<\/p>\n<p>While not designed primarily as a weight-loss program, the DASH diet can prevent dangerous conditions that develop later in life as a result of both obesity and long-term unhealthy eating habits. High cholesterol and hypertension are both factors linked to the development of heart disease - and heart attack is the primary cause of death in adults in the United States. Whether overweight or at a Body Mass Index (BMI) within normal range, teenagers and young adults can reduce their future heart attack risk by adopting the DASH diet on a long-term basis to preserve their overall health.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/dash-diet.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"The #1 diet plan in the US News & World report is federally-endorsed and supported by physicians, but you may not have heard of it.

Or at least they have no place in a low carb diet. The logic is as follows: When you eat sugar, your insulin levels spike, which increases the rate at which your body stores fat. Since fruits are high in sugar, they will spike your insulin levels and cause you to put on fat.<\/p>\n<p>This seems convincing at first glance. In this article, we explain where it fails - and why every diet should include fruit.<\/p>\n<h4>Fruits Contain Fiber<\/h4>\n<p>Unlike a spoonful of sugar, fruits contain dietary fiber, which slows down the digestion of sugars in the body. It increases the feeling of satiation by adding bulk to the diet and aids the stomach in processing food. The two different types of dietary fiber are termed \"soluble\" (attracting water) and \"insoluble\". Fruits with soluble fiber can make someone feel full faster because of the water-attracting property. Apples, naval oranges, and blueberries are three examples of fruits with a high soluble fiber content. Additionally, fruits with soluble fiber have been linked to blood glucose homeostasis - so they are preferable for diabetics. Soluble fiber is also associated with lower blood lipid levels. Finally, fiber - both soluble and insoluble - has a low energy density so is recommended in dieting to achieve weight reduction.<\/p>\n<h4>Fruits Have Nutritional Value<\/h4>\n<p>Unlike simple sugar, fruits contain vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals (e.g., anti-oxidants and phytoestrogens) are abundantly found in fruits. These nutrients are important for health as well as the prevention of disorders associated with vitamin deficiencies. Fruits are higher in Vitamin C, potassium, and folic acid than most other foods consumed on a daily basis. In combination with fiber, the nutritional content of fruits is protective against coronary heart disease (especially as caused by hypertension). According to an article in 2012 in <a href=\"http:\/\/advances.nutrition.org\/content\/3\/4\/506.long\">Advances in Nutrition<\/a>, obesity risk is lower in those who consume on average more fruits and vegetables per day than those eating a low plant-based daily diet.<\/p>\n<h4>Recommended Fruit Intake<\/h4>\n<p>The adequate intake (AI) value for fiber according to the Institute of Medicine is 14 grams of fiber\/1000 calories (or approximately 25 grams of dietary fiber in a 2000 calorie diet). This exceeds the amount of fiber in the typical American diet. For women and men between 19-30 years old, two cups of fruit per day is recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (according to ChooseMyPlate.gov). After 31 years of age, the recommendation changes to 1.5 cups for women and 2 cups for men. Eating fruit uncooked is generally recommended to increase nutritional value.<\/p>\n<p>Diabetic diets often limit daily intake of sugar to avoid a hyperglycemic reaction. Since lemons and limes have the least sugar content of all fruits, these are especially good in diabetic menus. Substituting vegetables for fruits (i.e., carrot juice instead of apple juice) can also help in reducing sugar intake.<\/p>\n<p>Diets high in refined sugar have been linked to obesity as well as Type 2 diabetes. For this reason, it is a terrific idea to limit consumption of refined sugar as much as possible. Coffee shops that assume customers want sugar added - along with milk - should consider refraining from offering that sugar. In fact, coffee-drinkers who have to ask for sugar might think twice before shaking a packet of empty calories into their morning brew!<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/fruit-sugar.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Unlike a spoonful of sugar, fruits contain dietary fiber, which slows down the digestion of sugars in the body.","date_published":"2014-05-21 11:55:40","published":"1","seo_url":"fruit-sugar-v-refined-sugar.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"46247","author":"183"},{"id":"378","name":"Tips for Starting a New Workout Program","body":"<p>Joining a new gym or changing a fitness routine can require an assessment of exercise needs. Minor disorders and injuries can necessitate a switch - such as a sprained ankle temporarily preventing jogging on a treadmill. The change from normal routine can require a re-assessment of exercise effects, such as the number of swimming pool laps necessary to reach the same target heart rate. The involvement of a fitness coach can help you transition to the new work-out program, but you also need to consider the three following factors:<\/p>\n<h4>Familiarity with the Equipment or Activity<\/h4>\n<p>Switching to a new fitness center may require learning how to use new equipment - and it is important to request instruction if unsure how to operate it. This is also true if the equipment has been purchased from from a retail store for home use. The improper use of weight-training equipment can lead to injury. Likewise, beginning a new activity can necessitate an evaluation of the time needed to produce the same result. Riding a stationary bicycle for a half hour may not burn the same number of calories as utilizing a stair-climber for the same amount of time. Most modern exercise equipment utilized in fitness centers include heart rate monitors and calorie counters, so it may be a simple process of comparing the results and adjusting your work-out accordingly.<\/p>\n<h4>Enjoyment of the New Workout Facility or Activity<\/h4>\n<p>Enjoying your exercise time will provide an incentive to incorporating it into your daily routine. If you are uncomfortable with the new fitness center or activity, you are less likely to continue with the new workout plan. One of the main reasons that obese individuals discontinue a workout program undertaken at a fitness center is discomfort at having others view them in typical fitness attire (e.g., tank tops and shorts). Significantly overweight people are often subject to prejudice and humiliation in their everyday lives. Obese people will often choose to wear clothes that enable them to appear less overweight. If other fitness center members stare at them, obese people often feel ashamed of their appearance - and quit their exercise program at the fitness center causing them discomfort. Even for people who are not overweight, feeling personally comfortable at the fitness facility is important to continuing an exercise regimen. Likewise, enjoying a new activity - such as water aerobics - has a major impact on the likelihood of engaging on a routine basis in that fitness activity.<\/p>\n<h4>Changing Dietary Needs<\/h4>\n<p>Switching to a new workout program can involve a change in an existent weight-loss diet. For persons who were dieting but sedentary (with no regular exercise), the initiation of an intensive workout program can mean the daily maximum calorie intake can be increased. Instead of a low-calorie diet, the individual may be able to increase their daily calorie allowance due to burning off calories at the gym.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to embark on a successful workout program is to find an enjoyable activity that includes exercise - and turn it into just another routine habit!<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/new-workout.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Grab some quick tips for starting your new workout program the right way.","date_published":"2014-04-13 22:03:41","published":"1","seo_url":"starting-a-new-workout.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"45960","author":"172"},{"id":"484","name":"Dietary Fiber Explained","body":"<p>Food manufacturers, restaurants, and health food stores alike are always highlighting foods that are high in fiber content. Dietary fiber has long been valued for its nutritional potential, but is there any substance to all of the hype?<\/p>\n<p>Nutritionists agree that fiber is a necessary component to everyone&rsquo;s diet, with both children and adults needing to consume between 20 and 30 grams of fiber every day. The average American, however, only gets about half of that. Find out more about why fiber is so important&nbsp;and how you can be getting more of it in your diet.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How it Works&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As a rule, the human body is unable to digest fiber. Other carbohydrates are usually broken down into sugar molecules, but not fiber. Instead, the unbroken carbohydrate molecules of fiber pass through the body, regulating the body&rsquo;s use of sugars and aiding in digestion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are two varieties of dietary fiber: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber dissolves in water, and lowers glucose and cholesterol levels in blood. Insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water, and aids in digestion by helping food move through your digestive tract.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sources of Fiber<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Soluble fibers come from a variety of sources including oatmeal, nuts, beans, lentils, apples, and blueberries. Most whole fruits are good sources of fiber too, but fruit juices, except those with lots of pulp, are relatively fiber-less.<\/p>\n<p>The key to insoluble fibers is eating whole grains like whole wheat bread, whole grain couscous, brown rice, and legumes (peanuts, beans). Vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, and tomatoes are all sources of insoluble fibers as well. Again, it is better to go with whole vegetables instead of vegetable juice as far as fiber is concerned.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>High-Fiber Recipes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>15-Minute Lentil Soup&mdash;<em>51 g Dietary Fiber (200% Daily Value)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a title=\"Lentil Soup\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yummly.com\/recipe\/15_Minute-Lentil-Soup-Martha-Stewart?columns=5&amp;position=5%2F54\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em><img src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/Yw3VwRBX-BeKrYDhuCNEZ9gNWeKHUaUipkIu02VFPhfP0BXA2mWvEdVzfcfgVj1xEKBujgs51nYeG8eqgXNO=s230-c\" alt=\"Lentil Soup Picture\" width=\"230\" height=\"230\" \/><\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The best way to get fiber in your diet is by eating fruits and vegetables that are high in fiber, such as lentils.

We think that if we don't diet extra strictly, deprive ourselves of our favorite foods, and spend all day on the treadmill, we won't make any progress. We either pursue impossible programs, or give up without trying. There is a middle ground. By progressively making adjustments to your diet, you can slowly transition to a healthier lifestyle and build the foundation for long-term health. Here are four simple changes to get you started. By following them, you can make positive progress toward health without sacrificing so much right off the bat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Reduce Your Daily Carbohydrate Intake<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Marathon runners and mountain-climbers need a high carbohydrate intake because carbs provide a burst of energy. Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates at mealtime, however: meals are often focused around bread, potatoes, and rice. Reducing your consumption of foods that are high in carbohydrates can quickly reduce your daily calorie intake. This will also prevent crashes later in the day, which are a consequence of the quick burst of energy from carbohydrates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Begin or Increase Your Daily Exercise Routine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Aerobic exercise can burn calories, and can improve cardiac function. However, its main advantage in weight loss is that it can increase metabolic rate. Therefore, an individual who engages in daily aerobic exercise is likely to burn calories at a faster rate than a person with a sedentary lifestyle. This is why clinical assessments usually include questions about diet <em>and<\/em> exercise prior to developing a weight loss plan for a patient.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Drink More Plain (or Carbonated) Water<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, people who are attempting a diet are unable to feel a sense of \"fullness\" following a meal simply because they are not consuming as much food. Water has no calories, but can produce this feeling of gastric \"fullness\" due to signals transmitted to the brain from the digestive system. Another benefit is the faster elimination of water-soluble waste via the kidneys and urinary tract, which aids in the elimination of bacteria-causing diseases. And if you're exercising regularly, hydration is a must - especially if you're trying to gain muscle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Dial Back Portion Size<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Calorie consumption per day among adolescents has increased dramatically in the past 40 years. Plate-size is larger than before the 1950s - and the manufacture of modern dinnerware has insidiously affected eating habits. Restaurants often serve customers in over-sized plates and glassware because it makes diners feel that they are getting their money's worth from the owners. The result is that the portions on the plate are unnecessarily large. One egg and one slice of toast with juice or coffee can typically be adequate in terms of producing \"fullness\" and caloric value - but most people eat more just because it's on their plate. Try out this easy change! While at first it may feel like there isn't enough food on your plate, it will likely be enough to fill you up.<\/p>\n<p>These diet changes in tandem can really give you more \"bang\" for your \"buck\" when it comes to weight loss!<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/diet-changes.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"By progressively making adjustments to your diet, you can slowly transition to a healthier lifestyle and build the foundation for long-term health.

In the past few years, many celebrities - including Katy Perry, Oprah, and Bill Clinton - have introduced or endorsed popular diet plans. This often leads to lucrative endorsement deals, which raises the question: Do these diets work or do celebrities just want to make an extra buck? Below, we examine three popular celebrity diets to answer this question.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. The Air Diet.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This diet is laughably bad. It's not only embarrassing, but also irresponsible and immoral, that Madonna endorsed the diet in 2010. The air diet is pretty simple: the only things you can consume are water and a salt-soup mixture. Even worse, you're supposed to attend meals and <em>pretend<\/em> to eat. This is a great way to lose weight - and your health and sanity.<\/p>\n<p>To reiterate: This is <em>not<\/em> a diet. It's starvation. Avoid it at all costs. And to the 3 people reading this who still listen to Madonna, please stop.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Sunfare.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sunfare is a diet delivery service that has been endorsed by Kim Kardashian. Kardashian says, \"It's the only diet I can stick to. It makes me eat healthy because the food is at my house when I wake up.\" This is accurate: Sunfare offers a healthy diet plan that will improve the health of most people who use the service. However, the main strike against this diet is how expensive it is. The average American family of three spends $150 each week on food - about $7 per person every day. Sunfare, however, costs a whopping $30 per day. It's unclear whether Ms. Kardashian endorses the diet because she's wealthy enough to afford it, or because she wants to rip you off. In either case, Sunfare isn't worth the price.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. The 5-Factor Diet.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Katy Perry recently endorsed the 5-factor diet, which is touted as a \"lifestyle plan\" as opposed to a diet. The plan is a little gimmicky: eat <em>five<\/em> meals per day, each with <em>five<\/em> ingredients; workout <em>five<\/em> times per week by completing <em>five<\/em> <em>five<\/em>-minute exercise routines; etc. Nevertheless, the plan makes sense and contains elements that will improve your health and contribute to weight loss. The diet requires that each meal include all five of the following food groups: protein, complex carbohydrates, fiber, healthy fat, and a sugar-free beverage. That's it! Plus, the diet allows for one cheat day each week where you can eat whatever you want to maintain your sanity. Though effective, this diet is by no means original. It advocates principles that are present in most effective diets: eat lean protein, complex carbohydrates, and lower sugar consumption. But at least we know Katy Perry still has her integrity.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/celebrity-diets.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Do these diets work or do celebrities just want to make an extra buck?

The complexity of the diet world is enough to make your head spin. What the advocates of these individual diets don't want you to know is that most of them are based on the exact same principles. Don't listen to anyone who wants to take your money in exchange for \"expert\" diet advice. With a little math and determination, you can take control of the weight loss process.<\/p>\n<p>The simplest way to identify the number of calories needed for weight loss is to first determine the number of calories needed to maintain your current weight. Multiplying your weight by 11 and 15 provides a range of calories needed for weight maintenance - more if you tend to be active and less if you tend to be sedentary. Reducing the number of calories needed to sustain your current weight will help you slim down, as will exercising, to burn additional calories consumed.<\/p>\n<p>Identifying the amount of weight you can lose through exercise, cutting calories, or both begins with the number of calories in one pound of fat, 3,500. Losing one pound of fat per week requires a reduction of 500 calories per day. This can be achieved by eating less and\/or exercising more.<\/p>\n<p>Reducing your consumption can help in the short term, but exercise will produce lean muscle mass, a higher metabolism, and more sustainable weight loss. Additionally, reducing calories consumed to 1,100 or less will result in a lower metabolism. The key is identifying the maximum number of calories you need to feel satisfied while increasing your physical activity.<\/p>\n<p>As you begin your weight loss journey, keep in mind that this is a process and not an event.

It wasn&rsquo;t long before eating foods high in antioxidants became a popular health-food trend. Now, it is commonplace for food manufacturers to boast about the antioxidant content of their products. Recent studies, however, suggest that antioxidants may not be the all-powerful nutrients that we believe them to be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Are the claims surrounding the importance and potential health benefits of antioxidants really just hype? In this article, we take a closer look at the research around antioxidants and discuss their actual nutritional value. &nbsp;<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>The Claims<\/h3>\n<p>Doctors and nutritionists list a whole spectrum of potential benefits connected to antioxidants. Expectations are certainly high for antioxidants, with these&nbsp;potential benefits including&nbsp;prevention of ailments, from heart disease to cancer.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Cancer Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>As you can&nbsp;imagine, there have only been a small handful of trials that have gone on long enough to provide useful data on the topic of antioxidants preventing cancer. The studies that have taken place show that the antioxidants they looked at have little, if any, effect. Results from trials like HOPE and SU.VI.MAX only supported&nbsp;antioxidants being effective cancer preventers when the subject went into the trial with a deficiency of that chemical. For example, in a random trial of the antioxidant selenium in people with skin cancer, the only subjects who showed slowed or arrested growth rates after the addition of the antioxidant were those who began the trial without adequate levels of it.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Heart Disease Management and Prevention<\/h3>\n<p>The story is almost the same for preventing heart disease and stroke. Though many trials have been done, none show conclusive data for the effectiveness of any antioxidant as an agent of heart health. For example, in a study by Women&rsquo;s Health, almost 40,000 women were given bi-daily doses of either the antioxidant Vitamin E or a placebo. At the end of the trial, the rate of heart problems for&nbsp;women on the placebo did&nbsp;not vary from that of the women on the antioxidant regimen.<\/p>\n<h3><br \/>Antioxidant Redeeming Qualities<\/h3>\n<p>The idea behind antioxidants is logical enough. Diseases ranging from heart disease to cancer and Alzheimer&rsquo;s to vision loss are all caused by &ldquo;free radicals.&rdquo; Antioxidants are chemicals that inhibit the functioning of these free radicals, so, in theory, the more antioxidants the better. But what studies have been done in this field have been inconclusive at best. Preliminary trial results show that an artificial increase in antioxidants does not actually prevent or reduce risk for these conditions. There is one exception, however. Beta-carotene and other antioxidants naturally occurring in things like whole fruits, vegetables, and grains show promising signs of being able to retard the effects of aging and provide protection against conditions such as certain types of vision loss.

High blood sugar levels and dramatic spikes in blood sugar levels are a leading cause of many major health problems, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>The glycemic index (GI) is a ranking of carbohydrates on a scale from 0 to 100 (with sugar being 100) according to how much they increase your blood sugar levels. High GI foods cause extreme spikes in your blood sugar levels, whereas low GI foods cause a gradual and moderate rise. Thus, one of the best changes you can make to your diet is to substitute low GI foods for high GI ones.<\/p>\n<p>Below, we give a list of common foods and classify them according to their GI values. We also provide a few low GI recipes to get you started.<\/p>\n<h4>The Rankings<\/h4>\n<table class=\"reference\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>Classification<\/th><th>Type of Food<\/th><th>Examples<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: limegreen; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"5\">Low GI<\/td>\n<td>Beans &amp; Nuts<\/td>\n<td>white, black, kidney, lentil, soy, almond, peanut, walnut, chickpea<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seeds<\/td>\n<td>sunflower, flax, pumpkin, poppy, sesame<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Grains<\/td>\n<td>whole wheat, millet, oat, rye, brown rice, barley<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vegetables<\/td>\n<td>almost all<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fruits<\/td>\n<td>almost all<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"2\">Medium GI<\/td>\n<td>Grains<\/td>\n<td>enriched wheat, pita bread, basmati rice<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other<\/td>\n<td>grape juice, raisins, prunes, ice cream, bananas<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: coral; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"2\">High GI<\/td>\n<td>Grains<\/td>\n<td>white bread, white rice, corn flakes, bagels, pretzels<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other<\/td>\n<td>glucose, maltose, potato<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h4>Guidelines to Stay Low GI<\/h4>\n<p>On the off chance that you don't want to carry around a copy of the above table in your pocket 24\/7, here are a few guidelines to help you follow a low GI diet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Replace white carbohydrates with colored ones.<\/strong> White rice, white bread, white bagels, regular potatoes, and others are all high GI foods. On the other hand, brown rice, whole wheat bread, oats, and sweet potatoes are all moderate to low GI. This is the #1 change you can make to improve your diet. Changing your carb sources in this way will stabilize your blood sugar levels, decreasing your risk of the diseases listed above. It will also make you feel more energetic throughout the day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Fruits and vegetables are always great.<\/strong> Every good diet incorporates fruits and vegetables because they're packed with nutrients. Good news: They're low GI too!<\/p>\n<h4>Drawbacks to a Low GI Diet<\/h4>\n<p>The low GI diet tends to paint with a broad brush. On the whole, making changes like switching from white to whole grains or including more vegetables in your diet are certainly positive. On the other hand, adhering too closely to the glycemic index can cause problems. For example, parsnips have a higher GI value (52) than vanilla cake (42). So you'll want to use a little common sense when you apply it to your own diet.

Pastor Rick Warren's New Diet Plan","body":"<p>The \"Daniel Plan\", as published by Pastor Rick Warren, is a lifestyle makeover program that is based on 5 tenets: faith, food, fitness, focus, friends. Warren says he came up with the idea when he was baptizing members of his congregation, reportedly 800 of them in one day, and realized they were all overweight, as was he. This was his motivation to lose weight himself and challenge his followers to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>The bible story of Daniel sets out in chapter one that Daniel rejected the rich foods and wine offered by the king, insisting on \"nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink... At the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food.\" This is where this program gets its name, and provides the foundation for the \"food\" component of it. The Daniel Plan does recommend eating lots of vegetables, but does not exclude meat and animal products (eggs and cheese are allowed in moderation). There's also allowance for occasionally indulging in favorite snacks and treats without judging yourself harshly. Overall, the food advice seems logical and in line with other published guidelines, in fact nearly identical to the US government Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Likewise, the \"fitness\" element of the Plan introduces nothing revolutionary. Based in common sense, it offers advice such as \"choose activities you enjoy\", stay hydrated, warm up before you exercise, and cool down afterwards. The primary difference seems to be syntax: principles are all encased in deeply religious language. If you're offended by frequent gratuitous references to God, you'll probably be annoyed after just a sentence or two of the Plan.<\/p>\n<p>Like many fad diet plans, the Daniel Plan comes with a lot of sleek-packaged marketing, a modern, interactive website, and celebrity authors - including Dr. Oz of Oprah daytime TV fame. The Plan has been criticized for coercing its followers, both members and nonmembers of Warren's giant congregations, into buying the books and other materials. Let it be noted that this is no new phenomenon; any marketed diet plan like Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, or Slim Fast is centered on selling you their products. This is why they're in business and how they become recognized brands. A murkier moral zone is this: when entire congregations pledge to do the Daniel program (which is encouraged on the website), would&nbsp;individuals in the group feel comfortable saying no to joining?<\/p>\n<p>This brings up the \"friends\" element of the plan. While decidedly and unapologetically encouraging fellowship in a Christian organized religious setting, the literature of the Plan talks about how social networks influence our lifestyles. The website states that \"community is more effective than any medication\", and makes valid points that more sustainable change is possible with the support of a network. Support groups have been very successful in helping people make intentional changes in their lifestyles, from highly organized systems like AA, to something as simple as getting a workout partner.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, the Daniel Plan offers some sound advice on basic nutrition and fitness. Is it anything new? Not really. This program is not going to appeal to everyone, but for thousands of Americans it is really helping them to get motivated, work with support of friends and church communities, start eating better and exercising. For those that like this religion-centered approach, it can bring about positive change in their lives.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/the-daniel-plan.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"The Daniel Plan, as published by Pastor Rick Warren, is a lifestyle makeover program that is based on 5 tenets: faith, food, fitness, focus, friends.

With the convenience of online ordering services like grubhub.com and foodler.com, it is becoming easier and easier to do just that.<\/p>\n<p>Is it possible to order delivery without busting your diet open at the seams? The short answer is: yes!&nbsp;In this article, we look at ways you can stick to your diet when ordering delivery. We also discuss certain factors you have to take into account, and what to avoid getting delivered to your door.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Pizza<\/h3>\n<p>Possibly the archetype for delivery food, pizza is an American staple. Where you&rsquo;re from may have a strong bearing on the type of pie you get, but wherever you are, you can make healthy choices. As a rule of thumb, thinner pizzas are slightly healthier than the thick, cheesy, deep-dish alternatives. Some pizza places offer whole-wheat crusts, and it&rsquo;s definitely worth asking about.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you can&rsquo;t be convinced to change style, at least consider choosing healthier options for what you put on top. As far as toppings go, this should be obvious; go with more vegetables, less fatty meats, and less red meat protein.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Chinese\/Asian Cuisine<\/h3>\n<p>Besides pizza, Asian food is one of the most popular choices for takeout and delivery. While crispy, fried, often-oily dishes are staples of Asian-American restaurants, it is possible to get the flavors you love from your favorite dishes while&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;making healthy choices.<\/p>\n<p>For example, replace your usual fried wontons or dumplings with the just as tasty steamed version. Get a fresh spring roll instead of a fried eggroll. The trend is easy to pick up on&mdash;cut out the fatty fried options wherever possible. Another change you can make is opting for whole grain brown rice instead of white rice or fattening noodles. <br \/>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>The Takeout Takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>Ordering delivery doesn&rsquo;t have to ruin all of the hard work you put into dieting. Many takeout and delivery options are actually quite healthy. With so many world cuisines and American favorites, it would be a shame to ignore some of your local restaurants. Just keep basic dietary guidelines like low fat, no fried food, and the importance of whole grains in mind, and you can have a delicious, effort-free meal at your door in a matter of moments.&nbsp;<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/600\/Diet\/rsz_shutterstock_64506571.jpg","image_url_small":"\/articlesContents\/370\/Diet\/rsz_1shutterstock_64506571.jpg","meta_description":"In this article, we look at ways you can stick to your diet when ordering delivery.

Worse still - it's on the rise in America. In the past 20 years, its incidence has jumped from 24% (43 million Americans) to 30% (over 75 million Americans). In response to this crisis, researchers have developed Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, called the DASH diet. The diet is endorsed by dietitians and government health agencies alike.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we cover the basic principles of the DASH diet to make you better equipped to treat or prevent hypertension.<\/p>\n<h4>The Plan<\/h4>\n<p>The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low- or non-fat dairy. It also incorporates lean protein sources like fish and poultry and healthy fat sources like nuts and seeds. The diet is very similar to the <strong>Mediterranean diet<\/strong>. The following table shows the exact DASH diet prescription.<\/p>\n<p>Fish or poultry2 or fewer<\/p>\n<table class=\"reference\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>Type of Food<\/th><th>Number of Servings (2000 Calorie Diet)<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: limegreen; font-weight: bold;\">Grains<\/td>\n<td>7-8<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"1\">Fruits<\/td>\n<td>4-5<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: coral; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"1\">Vegetables<\/td>\n<td>4-5<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"1\">Low fat or non-fat dairy<\/td>\n<td>2-3<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"1\">Nuts, seed, legumes<\/td>\n<td>1 every day or two<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: coral; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"1\">Fats and sweets<\/td>\n<td>1 every two or three days<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h4>Who Should Follow the Dash Diet?<\/h4>\n<p>As you might have noticed, the foods prescribed by the DASH diet are all low in sodium. This makes it an effective diet for treating or preventing hypertension, which is what it was originally designed to do. But it is also a great for many other health goals, including weight loss and cholesterol management.<\/p>\n<h4>DASH Diet Tips<\/h4>\n<p>It's a big commitment to switch diets on a dime. And constantly switching diets will reduce their effectiveness. So there are many reasons <em>not<\/em> to drop your current dietary approach and switch to DASH. In this case, here are a few principles - inspired by the DASH diet - that can easily apply to any dietary plan without completely changing it.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eat more fruits and vegetables.<\/strong> The DASH diet recommends 8-10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Fruits and vegetables are the cornerstone of any healthy diet - they are packed with nutrients, taste great, are easy to prepare, and help with a variety of conditions, including heart disease, hypertension, and obesity. Eat as much as you can.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Focus on lean proteins<\/strong> like fish and poultry instead of fatty red meats. This will do wonders for your cholesterol levels and heart health. Plus fish, especially salmon, are packed with healthy fats like omega-3s.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cut down the sweets.<\/strong> I don't need a reason to cut down the sweets. But notice that I said \"cut down\", not \"cut out\". Being to strict and not allowing yourself a treat is a great way to start hating your diet. If you hate your diet, you won't last very long with it. So enjoy some sweets a few times a week. It won't kill you, but it might save your diet.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/hypertension-and-the-dash-diet.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"In this article, we cover the basic principles of the DASH diet to make you better equipped to treat or prevent hypertension.

Health conscious people already structure their diets to lose weight, stay healthy, reduce cholesterol, and manage blood sugar, but few people realize how much control they have in cancer prevention. Surprisingly, research into cancer prevention has not changed the way many nutritionists think about diet. This is because many of the foods that help you fight off cancer will also help keep you healthy in other ways. One of these is broccoli, which has so many health benefits that it has earned the label \"super food\".<\/p>\n<h4>Cancer Prevention<\/h4>\n<p>Broccoli is unique in its cancer prevention qualities. Results from studies at Johns Hopkins University are surprising and amazing: they showed that broccoli could reduce the development of tumors up by 60%. Broccoli achieves this astounding result in a number of ways. Here are a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>broccoli contains powerful antioxidants that hinder the growth of breast, cervical, and prostate cancer,<\/li>\n<li>broccoli contains compounds that boost liver function and detoxification,<\/li>\n<li>broccoli has anti-inflammatory benefits, which can inhibit tumor growth.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Other Health Benefits<\/h4>\n<p>Broccoli has a number of other benefits besides cancer prevention. For example, it provides significant digestive support with its high fiber content, which improves nutrient absorption and prevents bacteria buildup in your intestines. Broccoli has also been shown to lower cholesterol, and it's very rich in a number of vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins K and C.<\/p>\n<p>You might be wondering <em>how much<\/em> broccoli you need to reap these benefits. If you detest the taste of broccoli, you're in luck, because you only need about 200 calories (or 2 cups) of broccoli per day to give you the full daily requirements of most of its nutrients. The recipe below contains exactly this amount.<\/p>\n<h4>Preparation<\/h4>\n<p>Before cooking, rinse the broccoli in cold water. From here, it's your call how you want to enjoy it.

Grain-Fed Beef: Is There a Difference?","body":"<p>Despite being more expensive, many consumers are choosing exclusively grass-fed beef. What makes this the better option for some? Some cite health concerns and others cite taste. What matters to you? First let's start with the basics.<\/p>\n<p>\"You are what you eat\" applies to the cow as much as it does to you. Calves start their lives drinking milk, followed by a liquid-based milk replacement. From the time they are weaned and separated from their mothers, the diet varies based on who's raising them and how.<\/p>\n<p>\"Grass-fed\" means that the cow has been fed any range of graminoids, including sedge, cane, and various species of grasses. \"Grass-fed\" labels can also include feed from hay, non-grain crop byproducts (such as husks or surplus vegetable produce), and some cereal grains in a pre-grain stage. A cow's digestive system, due to its microbial composition, requires a balance of minimal corn and grain content to large amounts of graminoids for best health.<\/p>\n<p>Most commercial cattle ranches use CAFOs (concentrated animal feeding operations), which provide a mix of grains and nearly any other filler that is inexpensive. The goal is to quickly bulk up the animal as much as possible, using as little space and the cheapest feed source available. CAFO processes encourage rapid weight gain; as the cow reaches about 700 pounds it moves into a dedicated feedlot where it packs on an additional 500-plus pounds within 3 to 4 months. A crowded, sedentary life means fatty deposits interspersed with muscle, which creates a marbled, softer meat quality.<\/p>\n<p>A pasture-fed cow will take several more months to reach comparable weights, requiring more space per animal; and resulting in greater expense over the course of the animal's life. However, the health of the animal is generally better, and the nutritional value from the meat is greatly enhanced.<\/p>\n<p>In conventional meat farming, little attention is paid to the comfort or quality of the animal's life. Why does that matter? Even if you have no interest in the ethical treatment of the animal you're eating, you may be interested in its nutritional content.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fats:<\/strong> Your body needs a balance of essential fatty acids. While you can get omega-6 from vegetable sources such as seeds and nuts, omega-3 is harder to find, fish being the highest source. Grass-fed, and particularly grass-finished, beef contains omega-3 where it is nearly nonexistent in grain-fed beef.<\/p>\n<p>Your body does not need more saturated fat, and while a grass-fed cow does have saturated fats, it is distributed in the cow's body more compactly (easier to remove) than a grain-fed cow, where it is mingled with the muscle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vitamin content:<\/strong> Grass-fed beef has higher levels of B-vitamins, vitamin E, K, and beta-carotene; and higher levels of minerals like selenium, calcium, magnesium.<\/p>\n<p>Grass feed will tend to be grown in more nutritious soil, not depleted by routines of soy or corn farming. Bottom line is that a cow fed on a nutritious, varied diet simply will have more nutrients in its body.<\/p>\n<p>Taste is, well, a matter of taste. Like venison or other wild game, cattle fed on natural grazing sources will be leaner. Some consumers find it to be stringy or tough consistency, while others appreciate the leaner less-marbled meat. Curious? Do a taste test for yourself. Grass-fed beef can be found at grocery chains such as Whole Foods, or sourced from a local farm - try sites like eatwild.com to find something in your area.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/grass-fed-beef.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Despite being more expensive, many consumers are choosing exclusively grass-fed beef.

For example, the most common gym exercise is the biceps curl, which effectively works only one muscle. Whether your goals are to build muscle, lose weight, gain strength, or get healthier, you should buck this trend like the plague. The focus of your workout should always be compound movements, that is, movements that use your major muscle groups and recruit many muscles at the same time. The staples for your lower body are the squat, deadlift, kettlebell swing, leg press and the staples for your upper body are the bench, overhead press, and bent-over row. There are many benefits to focusing on compound movements.<\/p>\n<h4>They Save Time<\/h4>\n<p>Since compound movements work many muscles at a time, one compound movement can replace many isolation movements, dramatically cutting down the number of exercises you do at the gym. For example, squats effectively target your calves, hamstrings, quads, glutes, and lower back all in one, so by adding them to your routine, you can replace calf raises, hamstring curls, leg extensions, and back raises. Four exercises for the price of one!<\/p>\n<h4>They Stimulate Weight Loss<\/h4>\n<p>As a rule, you burn calories based on how much energy you expend. That makes sense, given that a calorie is actually a unit of energy. Compound exercises use more muscle groups to move more weight, thus requiring more energy, burning more calories, and contributing more to weight loss.<\/p>\n<h4>Functional<\/h4>\n<p>\"Functional\" is the new buzz-word in exercise, much like \"organic\" or \"natural\" are buzz-words in nutrition. A functional exercise is one that is supposed to help you in real-life situations. According to Greg Roskopf, MS, who has worked with many professional athletes, \"The key to functional exercise is integration. It's about teaching all the muscles to work together rather than isolating them to work independently.\" This is the core of compound movements - recruiting many muscles to work together. This is important in everything from sports to everyday activities in staying healthy and preventing injury.<\/p>\n<h4>Technique Comes First<\/h4>\n<p>Technique is crucial in any exercise routine, but even more important when focusing on compound movements. This is because you will generally be working with heavier weights. Before adding any exercise, but especially a compound exercise, you must master correct technique. I find YouTube videos essential - it's very helpful to actually <em>see<\/em> the movements performed by experts.

High sugar levels, lots of fat, and harmful amounts of calories and salt are just some of the downfalls that come along with so many salad dressings that are available today. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t drench a nutritious salad with an unhealthy dressing. By knowing the right things to look out for on nutrition labels, you can enjoy all the flavor of salad dressing without losing any of the benefits of the salad you&rsquo;re putting it on. This article gives some pointers to help choose the healthier options, or even make your own.<\/p>\n<h3>What to Look Out For:<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Fat<br \/><\/strong>Never choose a full-fat option when it comes to picking out a salad dressing. That being said, there are still many so-called &ldquo;low-fat&rdquo; options that aren&rsquo;t as healthy as they may sound. It is generally a good idea to look for a product with around 8 grams of fat per 2 tablespoons (a standard serving size).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sugar<br \/><\/strong>This can be a little trickier than fat to deal with. Obviously, it is a good idea to look for salad dressing options with as little sugar as possible. The ideal limit would be 1 gram of sugar or less per 2 tablespoon serving. However, sometimes there is an inverse relationship between sugar and fat in certain salad dressings. For example, high-fat Kraft Buttermilk Ranch Dressing has 2 grams of sugar per serving, compared to the fat-free version, which has 11 grams. In this way, healthy-sounding dressings may not be good for you at all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Salt<br \/><\/strong>Especially if you are worried about your high blood pressure and heart disease, high levels of salt in your diet can be a big concern. Salad dressings often use salt to pack a flavorful punch, so look out for high-sodium levels. Some of the worst offenders have upwards of 230-550 mg of salt per serving, levels that can put you in a risky position.<\/p>\n<h3>Alternative:<\/h3>\n<p>A simple vinaigrette is an easy-to-make alternative to the unhealthy bottle that you are accustomed to. Follow these steps, and you&rsquo;ll have a healthy, tasty salad dressing in minutes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mince 2 tbsp shallots for a flavorful base.<\/li>\n<li>Add 2 tbsp sherry vinegar, or some other acid.<\/li>\n<li>Whisk together with &frac14; tsp each of salt and pepper.<\/li>\n<li>Add 6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil slowly, whisking as you pour.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This will keep in the fridge for the better part of a week; you just have to remember to stir it up before using it again.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/the-truth-about-salad-dressing.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"By knowing the right things to look out for on nutrition labels, you can enjoy all the flavor of salad dressing without losing any of the salad's benefits.","date_published":"2014-07-21 20:19:22","published":"1","seo_url":"the-truth-about-salad-dressing.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"40214","author":"180"},{"id":"403","name":"3 Components of a Heart Healthy Lifestyle","body":"<p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Its prevalence and severity cannot be overstated. Though there certainly are environmental and genetic factors at play, there are also key steps you can take to reduce your risk of heart disease. The three major components of a heart healthy lifestyle are diet, your exercise routine, and (perhaps surprisingly) your emotional state. In this article, we tackle each of these major areas, giving you important tips to help reduce your risk of heart disease.<\/p>\n<h4>Improve Your Diet<\/h4>\n<p>The most important factor of your diet is whether you can stick to it. If the food in your diet is unbearable to you, and you only follow it for a week before giving up, it's not the right diet for you. Having said that, here are four important guidelines to follow to ensure a heart healthy diet.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Eat more fruits and vegetables.<\/strong> Fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins and minerals and relatively low in calories. This means that most of the energy from the food goes straight to powering your daily activities instead of being stored as triglycerides in your blood. There's no excuse for not eating more fruits: they taste great. On the other hand, many people (myself included) struggle with vegetables. But they can taste great if you put effort into the preparation. Below are a few great recipes to get you started.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Select whole grains over white grains.<\/strong> This means whole wheat bread over white bread, brown rice over white rice, and even sweet potatoes over white potatoes. Whole grains are rich in fiber and other nutrients that help regulate blood pressure and maintain heart health.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Get your fats from nuts and oils, not animals.<\/strong> This will automatically mean you get healthier fats and reduce your intake of cholesterol and other artery-clogging fats.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eat less salt.<\/strong> This will happen naturally if you follow the three recommendations above, but it is important enough to be mentioned on its own. Excessive intake of salt is a leading cause of hypertension, a leading cause of heart disease.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Ramp Up Your Fitness Routine<\/h4>\n<p>Every year, the recommendation for minimum time spent exercising per week increases. What's going on? Is it possible that you need more exercise in 2014 than in 2013? The fact is that every year researchers discover new benefits of exercising - so they keep recommending more! It burns calories, helps control your cholesterol levels, and it makes you look and feel better. As with diet, the worst exercise routine is one you can't sustain. Pick a type of exercise you enjoy and do it at least 30 minutes for five days a week. Better yet - pick an event, like a 5k or a Tough Mudder, set a goal for yourself, and train to meet it. This can be a great motivation.<\/p>\n<h4>Ditch The Stress<\/h4>\n<p>This is a tough one, but it's sure to help. Managing stress will help you avoid smoking and overeating, and may even have a direct effect on your cholesterol levels and blood pressure. I know I don't like to be told how to behave, but when managing stress, people's inclinations are not always on the mark - because they're stressed!

It affects us and all those around us. Since diet is such an important factor in cardiovascular health, knowing what foods are good and bad for your heart is crucial.<\/p>\n<p>Although cholesterol is necessary for your body to function normally, many of the foods that people eat today contribute to higher levels of a &rdquo;bad&ldquo; form of cholesterol, called LDL, which can clog arteries and increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Cholesterol is made in the body naturally, but consuming animal products high in cholesterol, like whole milk or butter, can increase the amount that we have in our bodies to unhealthy levels.<\/p>\n<p>Foods that are high in saturated fats raise LDL levels. Solid fats like butter, margarine, and shortening are sources of saturated fats. Getting rid of these, or replacing them with unsaturated, is important for maintaining healthy levels of cholesterol. Not all fats are bad, though. In fact, many unsaturated fats can play beneficial roles in the body, like stabilizing heart rhythm and even improving cholesterol levels. These &rdquo;good&ldquo; fats can be found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and fish.<\/p>\n<p>Trans fat lowers your level of HDL, or &rdquo;good&ldquo; cholesterol, which functions to clean up &rdquo;bad&ldquo; LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream by carrying it to the liver so that it can be disposed of. A low level of HDL can also increase risk of cardiovascular disease because it slows down how quickly the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cholesterol can be removed from the bloodstream.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to reduce your levels of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cholesterol is to eat more fiber. Soluble fiber can reduce how much cholesterol is absorbed into the bloodstream. Foods that are high in fiber include fruits, vegetables, and whole grain products. A few foods that are a great source of fiber are oatmeal and flax seeds.<\/p>\n<p>Another factor that affects cardiovascular health is blood pressure. High salt consumption is linked to high blood pressure, which is a major risk factor for heart disease. Canned and processed foods tend to have high sodium content, so minimizing how many prepared foods you eat can cut down a significant portion of the salt in your diet.

It's a struggle to get enough vegetables and as a result, according to the Centers for Disease Control, only 1\/4 of Americans eat the recommended three servings of vegetables per day. There's no secret about why this is the case either. People avoid vegetables because they're expensive, difficult to prepare, and, probably most important, don't taste very good.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we introduce three awesome veggies that are just now coming into season. For each one, we have a healthy, easy, and great tasting recipe to help you enjoy them.<\/p>\n<h4>Eggplant<\/h4>\n<p>In contrast to other vegetables, eggplants are known for their unique, powerful taste. They are often an acceptable substitute for meat in dishes, like in eggplant parmesan. They also have a variety of health benefits. They have a great nutrient profile as a great source of fiber, potassium (<a href=\"http:\/\/dietanalytics.com\/articles\/benefits-of-potassium.html\">discussed here<\/a>), and vitamin B, among others. In addition, they are a rich antioxidant source and can improve cardiovascular health and protect against free radicals.<\/p>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Hoison Glazed Eggplant\" src=\"http:\/\/www.marthastewart.com\/sites\/files\/marthastewart.com\/imagecache\/wmax-520\/ecl\/images\/content\/pub\/everyday_food\/2006Q4\/edf_hoisineggplant_vert.jpg\" alt=\"Hoison Glazed Eggplant\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Hoison-Glazed Eggplant:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yummly.com\/recipe\/external\/Hoisin_Glazed-Eggplant-Martha-Stewart\">see the full recipe here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Cucumbers<\/h4>\n<p>Cucumbers don't receive much attention for their health benefits, but they're very real.

In fact, pharmaceutical companies are studing one group of compounds found in cucumbers, called <em>cucurbitacins<\/em>, to develop anti-cancer drugs. A study from the <em>International Journal of Health Sciences<\/em> has called them a \"promising target for cancer therapy\".

In fact, as far as food trends and fads go, eating whole grains has been one of the more popular ones, infiltrating all spheres of the food industry as the &lsquo;healthy choice.&rsquo; It would be hard to find a product, or an item on the menu in a restaurant or bakery for that matter, that doesn&rsquo;t have the option of being whole-grain.<\/p>\n\n<p>What is all the fuss about, though? Besides making the products they are used in an earthier tone of brown, whole grains add a slue of other benefits to the food you love. In this article, we discuss&nbsp;what makes whole grains so much healthier than processed grains.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>What It Means To Be &lsquo;Whole&rsquo;<\/h3>\n\n<p>A lot of what we eat could be considered a grain. From rice to corn to cereal, grains are everywhere in our diets, and all of them are seeds by definition. Seeds contain three components: the bran, the endosperm, and the germ. When not specified as made with &lsquo;whole grains&rsquo; most products you eat just use the endosperm of the seed. Any product or grain that uses all three components of the seed is considered to be whole grain.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Nutrients<\/h3>\n\n<p>The benefit of keeping the bran and germ parts of the seed in the final product is that you get all of the nutritional value of the grain included. Most notably, grains contain dietary fiber, B vitamins (such as riboflavin and folate), iron, magnesium, and selenium.<\/p>\n\n<p>As you may know, dietary fiber is a powerful agent in reducing blood cholesterol levels. This in turn lowers your risk for heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. It can also create a feeling of fullness that prevents over-eating and associated weight gain.<\/p>\n\n<p>There are many different nutrients that fall under the scope of &lsquo;B vitamins&rsquo; and whole grains contain a lot of them. Riboflavin, for example, helps the body efficiently metabolize food. Folate, or folic acid, helps form red blood cells.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the subject of blood, whole grains are also a good source of iron, which helps the blood transport oxygen. Especially in women of childbearing age who are iron-deficient, any extra natural source of iron is more than welcome.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h3>Why White?<\/h3>\n\n<p>These were just some of the nutrients and benefits of whole grains, begging the question: why wouldn&rsquo;t you choose whole grains? Not to mention, whole grains have a richer taste than refined grains found in white breads, white rice, and other products.<\/p>\n","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/600\/Diet\/rsz_shutterstock_144402331.jpg","image_url_small":"\/articlesContents\/370\/Diet\/rsz_1shutterstock_144402331.jpg","meta_description":"Besides making the products they are used in an earthier tone of brown, whole grains add a slue of other benefits to the food you love.

How do we assure that we all have sustainable food sources for ourselves and future generations? Can we even make a difference?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is yes. Even by small increments, the choices we make on an individual level will impact our farmers, grocery stores, local, national and global communities.<\/p>\n<p>Our decisions start with what to eat. Regarding our food source, we must take many factors into consideration: resources used in production and processing, resources used for distribution, the amount of food necessary for nutritional needs, and the waste by-products from our packaged and processed foods.<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest questions is whether to consume meat or no meat (or other animal products, for that matter). Raising animals obviously takes greater land resources, about 3 times as much land as growing crops. Many crops, 70% by some reports, are grown specifically for the purpose of feeding livestock. Take into account water usage, fuel for any machinery used for raising the feed crops, maintaining livestock and processing the animal products. By land and resource usage, especially on a global level, an animal-centered diet is vastly less efficient. If you are eating meat, consider buying only meat that has been grazed, fed limited processed grain-based feed, raised and butchered responsibly, locally if possible.<\/p>\n<p>So let's turn to a vegetarian or vegan diet. It is very possible to replace all the nutrients found in meat with those in plant sources. However, meat products are packed more densely, in sheer caloric (food energy) value; thus the necessary quantity of plant-based food is greater to provide a comparable caloric intake. So for example one ounce of meat, could take nine ounces of vegetables to replace.<\/p>\n<p>The climate you live in has an impact on greenhouse gases emitted. If you live in a northern region, whose winters are unsuitable for vegetation year-round; fresh produce can be provided only by importation, or by artificially heating and lighting greenhouses. These options utilize fuel and water resources. Shopping local is always a good choice, if you can get food that didn't have to be transported a long distance, and you don't have to travel far to pick it up. By most studies, the total carbon footprint is still generally less for a plant-based diet; but these are all factors to be considered.<\/p>\n<p>Let's talk about packaging. Since food is bought and consumed universally, multiple times a day, every consumer is contributing to discarding the packaging of these food items. Food packaging is estimated to make up two-thirds of all municipal solid waste. And more garbage leads to more landfill, less space to be used for food production, more harmful emissions. Part of our food choices need to include what kind of package we bring home with it. The most conscientious choice we can make, is the most nature-oriented one, or NO packaging. Your local farmer's markets will be total winners here, offering fresh-from-the-field fruits and vegetables; if you bring your own reusable bag it's the least amount of packaging waste.<\/p>\n<p>As food consumers (the average American eats about one ton of food per year), we each have a big influence on how food will be produced, shipped, and marketed. Business decisions are made on money, so if we put our dollars towards choices we believe in, the systems will change as well.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/environmentally-conscious-diet.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Learn how to make sure your diet is not only good for you, but good for the environment as well.

For people who avoid exercising due a former back injury (or fear of injury), there are workouts that can actually help in the healing of back pain or even prevent it. It may seem counter-intuitive, but exercising your back is the primary way to ward off a back problem. Below are exercises that are good for your back - plus the reasons exercise can decrease existing back pain.<\/p>\n<h4>The Relationship of Extensor Muscles to Back Health<\/h4>\n<p>Improper lifting technique (i.e., bending from the waist with straight knees) is the main cause of muscle strains in the lower back. Herniated disks can also cause major back discomfort - as can loss of vertebral cartilage due to low bone density. The result is that extensor muscles can become over-stretched. The resulting muscle pain can make a gym workout seem impossible. However, strengthening the back muscles is the best way to reduce the likelihood of a lumbar strain - along with always employing the proper lifting technique of bending the knees to lift objects off the floor.<\/p>\n<h4>How Yoga Can Reduce Back Pain<\/h4>\n<p>One of the key approaches to maintaining a healthy back is through flexibility. Yoga exercises that improve the flexibility of the back can prevent back strain. Yoga postures can also reduce back pain. A particularly good <em>hatha<\/em> yoga position for those experiencing sore backs involves lying on one side and pulling the knees up to the chest - and then resting in this position. Another is often called the fetal position, because it involves lying prone with forehead touching the floor while the knees are pulled up underneath the body. Curved into a ball in this manner, the muscles of the back are gently stretched. Unlike aerobic exercise or weight-training, the focus of <em>hatha<\/em> yoga is gentle stretching to increase flexibility. Taking an anti-inflammatory medication before exercising can also reduce the pain experienced during (and after) back-stretching exercises.<\/p>\n<h4>Water Aerobics and Swimming to Strengthen the Back<\/h4>\n<p>Physical therapists will often utilize a heated swimming pool with clients in need of muscle strengthening following treatment for a back injury. The advantage of water aerobics and swimming in preventing - and treating - lower back pain is that the water provides an extra cushion to soothe strained muscles. Swimming laps in a pool can strengthen the entire back as well as provide an excellent aerobic workout.<\/p>\n<h4>Exercises to Perform Before an Aerobic Workout<\/h4>\n<p>Lying on the back with knees pulled up to the chest - and held there for 30 seconds - can stretch the spine, and make a subsequent aerobic work-out possible for people with minor back pain due to tight muscles. It can also prevent straining the back while engaging in weight-lifting to improve upper body strength. Working in a sedentary job increases the risk of lower back strain and injury. For anyone whose occupation is sedentary in nature, it is advisable to incorporate stretching for flexibility before beginning a fitness routine of aerobic exercise or weight-training.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/back-pain.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"If you're avoiding exercise to avoid back pain, there are exercises that can heal your pain and get you back in shape.

Dieters tend to avoid fats because they are so calorie dense. One gram of fat contains nine calories while one gram of protein or carbohydrate only contains four. Since weight loss requires a caloric deficit, those pursuing weight loss reason that they need to avoid fats. Though this argument seems convincing, it's actually dead wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past few years, you may have heard the term \"healthy fats\" more and more. This implies that people generally think of fats as unhealthy, but that there are a select group of fats that are healthy. Instead, we should think about fats the same way we think about protein and carbs: some are good and some are bad; sometimes we should eat them and sometimes we shouldn't. Making blanket statements is easy, but doesn't yield great results.<\/p>\n<h4>The Benefits of Fats<\/h4>\n<p>The benefits of fats are now well-established, thanks to a growing body of scientific literature. Here are a few reasons not to abandon all fats:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fat is a dietary component that is vital to human growth and development. For as long as humans have been around, fats have been a major part of our diet.<\/li>\n<li>Many vitamins are fat-soluble, which means that eating more fats will help you absorb more vitamins.<\/li>\n<li>Monounsaturated fats (found in olive, peanuts, and avocados) can reduce cholesterol levels and lower your risk of heart disease and stroke.<\/li>\n<li>Fats are often very filling, so including them in your diet will not increase your caloric intake. In fact, carbs are most often responsible for a caloric surplus.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Good Fats and Bad Fats<\/h4>\n<p>I like to use the Mediterranean diet, widely considered a solid diet, as a way to distinguish between good and bad fats. The Mediterranean diet recommends eating lean meats, nuts, oils, and fruits and vegetables. How does the diet cut out bad fats while keeping to good ones? Simple. It avoids fats from animal sources - fatty meats and dairy - and emphasizes natural fats from nuts and oils. (Although avocados aren't a staple of the Mediterranean diet, I highly recommend them as well.)<\/p>\n<p>When constructing your next diet plan, whether your goal is improved health, weight loss, or increasing strength, be sure to include healthy fats from natural sources like nuts, oils, and avocados and avoid the fats found in beef, meat, and other animal products.<\/p>\n<p>Here's a great salad recipe that includes walnuts, a great source of fats:<\/p>\n<h4>Healthy Waldorf Salad<\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Healthy Waldorf Salad\" src=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/assets\/contentsFiles\/images\/recipe\/Healthy-Waldorf-Salad.jpg\" alt=\"Healthy Waldorf Salad\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 celery stalks<\/li>\n<li>2 scallions<\/li>\n<li>1 apple<\/li>\n<li>Handful of toasted walnuts, chopped<\/li>\n<li>Handful dried cranberries<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/recipes\/Healthy-Waldorf-Salad.html\">See full recipe here.<\/a><\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/nuts.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"This is a controversial statement, but it shouldn't be: if you want to lose weight or get healthier, you probably need to eat more dietary fats.

Exposure to cigarette smoke and pollution are considered likely factors in the increased national prevalence of asthma. Adult-onset asthma in the US is also on the rise. From the 1980s through 1990s, the prevalence of childhood asthma doubled - and certain regions of the country have a higher prevalence of asthma according to the <em>Centers for Disease Control<\/em> (CDC).<\/p>\n<p>Approximately seven million children suffer from asthma (of which around one million had an asthma attack in 2011), according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lung.org\/lung-disease\/asthma\/resources\/facts-and-figures\/asthma-children-fact-sheet.html\">American Lung Association website<\/a>. From 2001-2011, the number of individuals in the US living with asthma increased by 28% (per a CDC report entitled, \"Asthma Facts: CDC's National Asthma Program Control Grantees\" published in July, 2013). Asthma can be a life-threatening condition - especially in elderly individuals. The Northeast has a higher prevalence of asthma than in the South, according to the CDC.<\/p>\n<h4>Prevention of Asthma<\/h4>\n<p>Second-hand smoke is a major factor in childhood asthma. Obesity is also linked to the development of asthma (both in children and adults). While the air pollution level in urban areas may not be controllable by individuals, exposure to youngsters by parents is something that can be limited. The best approach is to embark on a smoking cessation program before childbirth.<\/p>\n<p>Decreasing consumption of potato chips, candy, and ice cream can also prevent children from gaining more weight than advisable for their Body Mass Index (BMI). It is extremely difficult for obese children to lose weight as adults. Not only is obesity linked to the development of asthma, but sleep apnea has been highly correlated to a BMI in the \"obese\" range. Since a diagnosis of asthma has been well-linked to classroom absenteeism, preventing this condition in children can increase the likelihood of improved grades in school.<\/p>\n<p>Pollen exposure is recognized as a trigger for an asthma attack - so springtime may be a particularly hazardous time for people with living with asthma. The height of pollen season occurs usually when trees are in the \"new bud\" phase. Limiting outdoor activities until buds have developed into leaves may lessen the likelihood of an asthma attack.<\/p>\n<h4>Quick-Relief and Long-Use Asthma Treatments<\/h4>\n<p>Corticosteroid inhalers are often prescribed for the long-term control of asthma symptoms, as well as the use of nebulizers (masks). For quicker, fast-acting relief, a person experiencing an asthma attack may utilize a beta<sub>2<\/sub>-agonist - such as albuterol - in an inhaler. Long-term use of corticosteroids has been associated with loss of bone density in older asthmatic individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Impoverished urban neighborhoods have a disproportionate share of the population living with asthma. It is thought that environmental hazards may play a contributory role - such as poor overall air quality. The lack of health care access for residents of these areas has resulted in a higher reliance on hospital emergency rooms for asthma treatment. Increased healthcare access may enable low-income families in inner cities to obtain better treatment, and thereby reduce the cost burden to the healthcare system as a whole.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/asthma.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Learn about asthma, what causes it, and how to prevent it.","date_published":"2014-04-16 09:59:24","published":"1","seo_url":"treat-and-prevent-asthma.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"36634","author":"172"},{"id":"359","name":"5 Pre-Workout Snacks That Will Stabilize Your Blood Sugar","body":"<p>To eliminate your risk of suffering from low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) during a workout, you may need to consume a pre-workout snack 30 to 60 minutes before you begin exercising.

However, you may find it difficult to consume the right amount of carbohydrate at the right time. If you consume an excessive amount of carbohydrate before your workout, you may put yourself at a greater risk of suffering from high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). If, on the other hand, you consume an insufficient amount of carbohydrate, you may put yourself at a greater risk of suffering from hypoglycemia.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You may need to experiment to determine the best pre-workout snack for your needs.

As summer approaches, now is the perfect time to fall in love with Swiss chard if you haven't already. Whether or not you're familiar with the culinary potential this green has to offer, you will be surprised by the immense nutritional value packed into every serving.<\/p>\n<p>Despite all of the hidden benefits chard has to offer, once you get to taste this delicious veggie, you won't need anything beyond its complex flavor to get you hooked for the rest of the season. This article will describe some of chard's lesser-known qualities, and give you tips on cooking it.<\/p>\n<h4>About the Plant<\/h4>\n<p>Swiss chard, or simply \"chard\", is a leafy green vegetable, with firm, brightly colored stalks and matching bright veins throughout the dark, sometimes-wrinkly green leaves. Contrary to what its name suggests, Swiss chard originated not in Switzerland, but further south, in the Mediterranean region. Chard is in the same family of plants as beets, but unlike its root cousin, the chard is grown almost exclusively for its leaves. Swiss chard is also related to certain leafy greens like spinach, whose similarity in flavor is hard to overlook.<\/p>\n<h4>Regulate Blood Sugar<\/h4>\n<p>Tests on animals have shown that the syringic acid found in chard helps to inhibit the function of a certain enzyme called alpha-glucosidase in the blood. That enzyme is responsible for breaking down carbohydrates into sugars, so by inhibiting the enzyme's activity, chard regulates blood sugar levels. This can help prevent many medical issues, including the development of diabetes.<\/p>\n<h4>Other Health Benefits<\/h4>\n<p>Antioxidants certainly are a desirable trait for health foods to have, and Swiss chard is packed full of them. From vitamins A, E, and C to the minerals zinc and manganese, chard contains a plethora of natural antioxidants. Now what do these antioxidants do for you? Besides reducing the risk for diseases that come as a result of oxidative stress, antioxidants also are anti-inflammatory agents. By preventing chronic, low-level inflammation, antioxidants lower the risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and arthritis, just to name a few.<\/p>\n<h4>How to Prepare<\/h4>\n<p>Swiss chard makes a wonderful side to most meals, and complements seafood and pork especially well. When prepared on its own, chard is best cooked by boiling for just three minutes. This tenderizes the fibers and reduces some of the oxalic acid, the chemical that makes it bitter, without any significant decrease in the nutritional benefits.<\/p>\n<p>A simple, yet tasty twist on the traditional preparation of Swiss chard is a recipe from Martha Stewart's kitchen called \"Spicy Chard with Ginger.\" This chard recipe creatively combines the bitterness of chard with the acidity and spiciness of peppers and ginger in a playful side dish that is sure to be a favorite.

When you eat more calories than you burn, your body converts all the surplus calories into triglycerides. Having triglycerides in your blood stream is totally normal. They are basically stored energy. In between meals, when you don't have food as an energy source, your hormones release the triglycerides for energy. However, you can have too much of a good thing. High triglyceride levels are linked to heart disease and stroke.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we further explain triglycerides and give advice on how to keep your triglyceride levels in a healthy range.<\/p>\n<h4>Triglycerides and Cholesterol<\/h4>\n<p>Triglycerides and cholesterol are often discussed together. They are very similar, but there are important differences. Both are types of fats that circulate in your blood. However, triglycerides store unused energy while cholesterol is used to build cells and hormones. Both are an important component of your blood composition. Often when you get blood work done to track your cholesterol levels, you'll get your triglyceride profile done too. So triglycerides and cholesterol are different fats, and have different effects on the body. Both contribute to increased risk of heart disease, though, so you'll want to keep careful watch on the levels of both in your blood.<\/p>\n<h4>Controlling Your Triglyceride Levels<\/h4>\n<p>The chart below shows the different ranges for triglyceride levels.<\/p>\n<table class=\"reference\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>Level<\/th><th>Measurement (miligrams \/ deciliter)<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: limegreen; font-weight: bold;\">Healthy<\/td>\n<td>&lt;150<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;\">Borderline High<\/td>\n<td>150-199<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: coral; font-weight: bold;\">High<\/td>\n<td>200-499<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold;\">Very High<\/td>\n<td>&gt;500<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We recommend that you test your triglyceride levels at least once a year. You can buy test kits and check your results against the table above, but having them checked at your next doctor's visit it probably cheaper and more convenient. If your levels are in the borderline high - high range, the following changes to your diet can help bring them down to a normal level.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cut back on sugars.<\/strong> Sugars are basically just calories. They have no real nutritional values. As noted above, a caloric surplus is exactly what causes increases in your triglyceride levels.

Unlike other fad vitamins or nutrients, the answer here is a resounding \"YES!\". Omega-3 fats play a variety of useful roles in the body. The catch, however, is that unlike other nutrients, omega-3's are not made in your body, so you have to get them through your diet. There are a number of ways to increase your intake of omega-3's - and given their health benefits, it's worth the effort.<\/p>\n<h4>What Are The Health Benefits?<\/h4>\n<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are actually a group of several fatty acids. For the chemistry whizzes here, omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. For normal people, omega-3 fatty acids are a group of fatty acids commonly found in plant and fish oils. There are three types most involved in human physiology: ALA, EPA, and DHA. ALA is primarily found in plant sources like nuts and seeds; EPA and DHA are primarily found in certain fish.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blood fat.<\/strong> Having high blood fat (triglyceride) levels puts you at increased risk of heart disease. The omega-3's found in fish - EPA and DHA - can help moderate elevated triglyceride levels.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis.<\/strong> One of the huge benefits of omega-3's is their contribution to joint health; they can curb stiffness and joint pain.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cognitive improvement.<\/strong> Studies have shown that fish oil can mitigate ADHD symptoms in children, including improved memory and learning. In the elderly, too, omega-3's can have huge congitive benefit. In particular, some research has shown that omega-3's protect against Alzheimer's and dementia, slowing the decline in cognitive function.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>How Can I Get More?<\/h4>\n<p>Omega 3's are present in a variety of foods. A few foods stand out as having a particularly high concentration of omega-3s. As mentioned above, ALA is found primarily in in plant oils. The top sources are flax seeds, walnuts, and mustard seeds. On the other hand, EPA and DHA are found primarily in fish oils. The top sources here are sardines and salmon. Here are two great recipes that will help you get more omega-3's. The first contains flax seeds and will help you get your ALA fix, while the second is a great salmon dish and will help you get more EPA and DHA.<\/p>\n<h4>Toasted Oatmeal with Strawberry Chia Jam<\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Toasted Oatmeal\" src=\"http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/zn4thEx6IdD6shBLaqJ_4Gkou2nkUQ73iDRKT311ILVD9u2nm75V0nWqREISfnLvCW3cQlfJm1Bjp4CMlgODFQ=s230-c\" alt=\"Toasted Oatmeal\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>Each component is delightful on its own, but they just so happen to combine marvelously well in one breakfast bowl.

As a general rule, it's always best to get your nutrients from whole foods. In some cases, however, supplements can be appropriate - that is, when they fill a small gap in your diet that you can't fill for some reason. Depending on your situtation, omega-3's could certainly fit the bill here. It's very easy to take a few fish oil capsules in the morning; much harder to eat salmon every night. In some cases, nutrients in supplements don't have the same benefits as nutrients in food. This is because nutrients work together in the body, but supplements isolate specific nutrients. In the case of fish oil supplements, however, the capsules have been shown to have positive health benefits, including joint pain relief.<\/p>\n<p>My final recommendation: try to get as much fish oil as possible from natural sources and supplement as a last resort.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/omega-3s.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"There are a number of ways to increase your intake of omega-3's - and given their health benefits, it's worth the effort.","date_published":"2014-05-02 12:08:18","published":"1","seo_url":"omega-3-fatty-acids.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"35635","author":"172"},{"id":"368","name":"How Healthy Fats Can Help You Lose Weight","body":"<p>We are bombarded with labels declaring that something is 'low-fat' or 'fat-free' so often that we automatically assume that fats are unhealthy. The truth, though, is that fat is something that your body needs. Biologically, fats allow our bodies to absorb vitamins and produce hormones that help maintain a healthy weight, among other things.<\/p>\n<p>Far too many people shun dietary fat, which only means they end up ravenous, with greater fluctuating blood sugar levels, and deficient in some of the important fat soluble vitamins that are critical for good health. Fat takes longer to digest, and the presence of healthy fats in your diets can help you feel satiated for a longer period after meals.<\/p>\n<p>This said, you do need to choose your fat intake wisely: if you select unhealthy choices, it'll harm your health, not help it.<\/p>\n<p>Let's go over the top five sources of healthy fats that you should be adding to your diet on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Salmon<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First, consider adding in some salmon. Salmon is rich in omega 3 fatty acids, which will boost brain health, help ward off disease, boost insulin sensitivity, combat fat gain, and many more other important benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, this is a must-have fat. You should aim to eat salmon at least twice per week on your diet plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Flaxseeds<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Next, consider adding some flaxseeds into the mix as well. Flaxseeds are high in fiber, rich in protein, and offer a good dose of healthy fats as well. Each tablespoon of flaxseeds will provide 2.8 grams of dietary fiber and 0.2 grams of sugar.<\/p>\n<p>Flaxseeds are easy to add into oatmeal, topped into a salad, or baked into muffins. Start using them more regularly for all these powerful health benefits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Coconut<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Moving along, don't overlook the power of coconut. Coconut is a specific form of saturated fat known as a medium chain triglyceride, which is actually very heart-healthy, despite what you might have heard about saturated fats before. There is some evidence coconut oil can improve insulin use, thus directly improving blood sugar management.<\/p>\n<p>Coconut oil has even more benefits for metabolism rate. Both it and other medium-chain fatty acids can cause a rise in body temperature after consumption, which is associated with your body burning calories faster.<\/p>\n<p>Try it in dried unsweetened form, through coconut milk, or through raw coconut instead. It offers a nice taste that most people will also really come to enjoy, so adds great flavor to your diet plan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Olive Oil<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finally, be sure that you are considering olive oil on a regular basis as well. Olive oil is a very heart-healthy fat that should never be overlooked. It's great for preparing stir-fries with, using as a base for marinades, or drizzling over your salad.<\/p>\n<p>Diets high in olive oil are have been linked to a higher level of a hormone, adiponectin, which helps our body break down fat.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avocado<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Finally, you have the avocado. This fat is high in fiber, so will offer good hunger and blood sugar control, and is also excellent for your skin as well. If you want to look younger, it's the fat to be getting in.<\/p>\n<p>Add to the fact that it has a nice creamy texture and consistency and you simply can't go wrong with this one. So there you have some of the best healthy fats to be adding to your diet on a regular basis. Do you see yourself missing any of these?

The dietary intake of more calories than necessary can promote a high triglyceride level in the bloodstream - which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CD) similar to increased cholesterol on a \"lipid panel\". Reduction of oxygenated blood flow to the heart results from fats causing arterial narrowing. Symptom-free persons may be unaware of their CD until experiencing a heart attack, so early detection and prevention are key.<\/p>\n<h4>Determining Recommended Fat Intake<\/h4>\n<p>In relation to daily caloric intake, seven percent is the recommended maximum for saturated fat per an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.heart.org\/HEARTORG\/Conditions\/Cholesterol\/PreventionTreatmentofHighCholesterol\/Know-Your-Fats_UCM_305628_Article.jsp\">article on the American Heart Association's website<\/a> . This translates to 15 grams per day on average. Red meat, butter, pizza, and cheese are the primary sources of saturated fat. Lowering consumption of these foods can improve blood cholesterol test results. Since one-third of all Americans have high cholesterol according to the <em>Centers for Disease Control<\/em>, reducing saturated fat intake is a good idea for millions of Americans.<\/p>\n<h4>Eliminating \"Trans Fatty Acids\" from the Diet<\/h4>\n<p>The type of fat most associated with high LDL cholesterol and atherosclerosis is \"trans fat\" as found in lard, margarine, and many processed foods. It is important if purchasing frozen dinners to ascertain the gram amount of this type of saturated fat, since the <em>American Heart Association<\/em>'s daily maximum recommendation for \"trans fat\" is no more than one percent.<\/p>\n<h4>The Value of an Annual Routine Physical Exam<\/h4>\n<p>It may seem unnecessary for a healthy individual to undergo an annual visit to a healthcare practitioner to have a blood sample drawn - to obtain cholesterol and triglyceride results (as well as other lipids that circulate in the bloodstream). A triglyceride lab value is generally considered within normal range if it is less than 150 mg\/dL. While there is greater public awareness of the dangers of a lab test result revealing an increased LDL cholesterol value, a report of high triglycerides can also enable a faster diagnosis of CD in \"at risk\" patients. People with poorly controlled diabetes often have high triglyceride levels (as do individuals suffering from kidney failure) which can lead to coronary artery disease.<\/p>\n<h4>Weight Loss for Lowering Cardiovascular Disease Risk<\/h4>\n<p>Obesity is a major risk for the development of CD - and decreasing daily calorie intake (as well as increasing aerobic exercise) can reduce the likelihood of developing a coronary artery thombosis. Angina occurs when the arterial blood flow to the heart is diminished. This can cause chest pain on exertion. If angina occurs at rest (as well as on exertion), it is considered a major factor in predicting heart attack. Losing weight can prevent the narrowing of the arteries that leads to angina.<\/p>\n<p>The relationship of an unhealthy diet that is high in calories and saturated fats is strongly correlated to obesity in adulthood. The easiest method to reduce cardiovascular risk in the population as a whole is through promoting good nutrition in youth. Preventing cardiovascular disease is much easier than reversing it - and untreated CD can too easily become a life-threatening condition.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/heart-disease.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Saturated fats clog your arteries and promote unhealthy plaque build-up that can result in heart damage.

They try to convince you that their product or strategy will make you lose weight - but this is not true. For people trying to lose weight, these myths are confusing and, even worse, sometimes dangerous. Individuals who accept these myths see poor results and often cause further damage to their health, and then experience an increased level of shame and frustration as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Five common diet myths that many people believe are as follows:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Myth Number 1: <em>All You Need To Do Is Eat Less<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Balanced nutritional intake is essential for overall health, and a vitamin or mineral deficiency can have negative consequences. While maintaining - or seeking - a Body Mass Index (BMI) in normal range is ideal, the cells of the body require a daily minimum amount of vitamins and minerals to perform their physiological functions and tasks. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of diabetes Type 2 (which is why a high BMI can \"flag\" a health problem to healthcare providers). However, maintaining a well-balanced diet is equally as important as weight loss to overall health.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Myth Number 2: <em>Exercising is as Effective as Dieting to Lose Weight<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The amount of exercise needed to adequately burn calories is far higher than most people realize. Diets that are \"calorie rich\" will normally produce weight gain. As people age and\/or become overweight, their metabolism slows down. Thus, more exercise is needed to compensate for the calories ingested - and a thin person will probably burn calories in their exercise regimen faster than someone who is overweight. In obese individuals, limiting the daily calorie intake is far more effective than attempting to burn off those calories already consumed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Myth Number 3: <em>Eliminating Fats is a Good Strategy for Dieting<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fats - along with proteins and carbohydrates - are essential nutritional elements. Certain key nutrients in the diet cannot be absorbed without fats (termed \"fat-soluble\" nutrients), and resultant vitamin deficiencies can produce dire effects on health. While reducing fats can improve cholesterol levels, eliminating fats is not a healthy approach to weight loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Myth Number 4: <em>Some People Cannot Lose Weight No Matter How Hard They Try<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Obese individuals often have longstanding eating habits (akin to addiction) that promote weight gain. The commitment to changing lifelong eating habits must exist - as well as a willingness to adhere to a strict diet over a lengthy period of time involving years. Gastric bypass surgery can also aid some obese people by reducing feelings of hunger.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Myth Number 5: <em>Vegetarian Diets Are Higher in Calories than Meat-Eating Diets<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many vegetarians eat more beans (e.g., lentils and soybeans), cornmeal, and rice in a single meal than in the typical \"meat-eater\" diet. The reason is that combining these three carbohydrate items results in a higher protein intake. However, tofu and cheese are excellent sources of protein - without the extra calories associated with carbohydrates. Carnivorous diets are often just as high in carbohydrates.<\/p>\n<p>Magazine and television ads promote myths that are harmful to the well-being of overweight people attempting to improve their health by shedding pounds. The key to healthy weight loss is following a diet plan that is nutritionally well-balanced, and reduces calories in direct relation to lifestyle and physical need.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/diet-myths.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Too many weight-loss promoters are lying to the public.

Muscles that depend on energy from glucose burn it at different rates, and your recommended heart rate maximum needs to be considered to establish a fitness routine that will not adversely affect your health. Four important considerations to determine if cross-fit training is right for you are listed below.<\/p>\n<h4>Amount of Time Available for Daily Exercise<\/h4>\n<p>For people who have a half-hour each day to devote to exercise, a cross-fit routine may be ideal. However, individuals who are not exercising every day can strain over-worked muscles in a \"high intensity\" workout that is followed by no exercise on the subsequent day. The result can be stiffness and soreness in muscle groups due to a loss of flexibility as the muscle contracts. For people who work out only three or four days per week, cross-fit training may not be as appropriate as a longer duration - but gentler - exercise plan that alternates between aerobic and weight-bearing exercise over the course of an hour.<\/p>\n<h4>Insulin Production, Hypoglycemia, and Diabetes<\/h4>\n<p>Individuals diagnosed with pre-diabetic or diabetic conditions need to be careful in undertaking cross-fit training. In an article published in <em>Diabetes<\/em> in 2002, intensive exercise was found to produce hyperglycemia with corresponding hyperinsulinemia in diabetic individuals, suggesting a need for quick-acting insulin administration following an intensive workout. For diabetic individuals, diet and insulin dependence must be factored into the intensity of the work-out in accordance with health monitoring.<\/p>\n<h4>Cardiac Abnormalities<\/h4>\n<p>For persons with no cardiac disabilities, cross-fit training may be an excellent fitness routine that promotes heart health. However, in people who have cardiac problems such as coronary artery disease or arrhythmia, the result of an intensive workout can be a heart attack. Aerobic exercise increases the heart beat (which should be maintained within a recommended range to not over-stress the cardiac muscle). Typical weight-bearing exercise does not increase heart rate as much as aerobic exercise (e.g., jogging). Cross-fit training differs from traditional fitness regimens in that aerobic exercise is continued throughout the routine - rather than decreasing to low-intensity for periods of weightlifting.<\/p>\n<h4>Availability of Fitness Equipment Promoting Cross-Fit Training<\/h4>\n<p>Most fitness centers contain the variety of equipment that can enable a healthy cross-fit regimen in healthy people. From running on a treadmill to pedaling a stationary bicycle to utilizing weight machines, it is possible to switch quickly to maintain a high aerobic level while working out a variety of muscle groups. Without a gym membership, the capacity to maintain well-balanced cross-fit program may not be easy. Runners can get an excellent aerobic workout, but may not be including any upper arm weight-bearing exercise in their routine. Likewise, daily swimming can improve flexibility and provide an aerobic work-out - but not provide the weight-bearing exercise that decreases the likelihood of age-related bone loss. Weightlifters may strengthen muscles, but not obtain an aerobic work-out during their exercise routine. The best overall exercise approach is to include activities that increase aerobic capacity, improve flexibility, and increase muscle strength. The important thing is to exercise in some fashion, rather than do nothing. Even walking on a regular basis is beneficial to health as opposed to a sedentary lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>The pros and cons of cross-fit training need to be considered on an individual basis. While this type of exercise regimen is ideal in healthy people, it needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. For individuals with pre-existing health conditions, another type of exercise program may be better to avoid potential negative health consequences.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/crossfit.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Learn about the most important aspects of Crossfit to consider in deciding to give it a try.

In essence, ONQI assigns each type of food a score (called a 'NuVal') between 1 and 100 that reflects how much nutrition the food provides relative to the number of calories it contains. For example, as you might guess, popsicles have a very low score because they have little nutritional value, but quite a few calories; on the other hand, broccoli achieves a score of 100 because it is packed with nutrients, and has very few calories.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we provide a more detailed description of the ONQI system and give tons of examples of foods and their scores. We also give general tips for how to follow these guidelines without actually having to memorize every value in the index. Finally, we have a few recipes that achieve very high NuVals to get you started.<\/p>\n<h4>The Method<\/h4>\n<p>The ONQI uses a patented algorithm to measure the nutritional quality of food. The ONQI algorithm first assesses the amount of over 30 different nutrients the food contains: this includes good nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fiber, as well as sugar, salt, trans fats, and cholesterol. The system goes into considerable depth, further assessing the quality of proteins, fats, and carbs. For example, eggs have very high quality protein because their rich amino acid composition makes them easy to digest. On the other hand, protein in grains like pasta and rice lack essential amino acids and are considered lower quality.<\/p>\n<h4>The Rankings<\/h4>\n<p>Here is a chart that contains ratings for many different foods. This list is nowhere near comprehensive, but it should give you a good sense of how the rankings turn out. (Hint: they turn out pretty much how you would expect them to.)<\/p>\n<table class=\"reference\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><th>NuVal Range<\/th><th>Type of Food<\/th><th>Examples<\/th><\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: limegreen; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"4\">75-100<\/td>\n<td>Fruits<\/td>\n<td>Blueberries, orange, pineapple, apple, mango, banana, avocado<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Meats<\/td>\n<td>Salmon, halibut, catfish, cod, oysters, swordfish steak<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vegetables<\/td>\n<td>Radish, cabbage, tomato, red onion, broccoli, breen bean<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Other<\/td>\n<td>Okra, oats, skim milk, quinoa<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"1\">50-74<\/td>\n<td>All<\/td>\n<td>Clams, whole milk, scallops, pasta<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: coral; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"1\">25-49<\/td>\n<td>All<\/td>\n<td>Turkey, peas, prunes, chicken breast, steak, orange juice<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold;\" rowspan=\"1\">0-24<\/td>\n<td>All<\/td>\n<td>Popsicle, soft drink, crackers, milk chocolate, hot dog, white bread, bacon<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h4>General Guidelines<\/h4>\n<p>As you can see, the ONQI is a very strict rating system. Not many foods outside of fruits, vegetables, and fish make it into the top group. Moreover, many foods otherwise considered healthy - like turkey, peas, and chicken breast - do not make it out of the bottom half. Our suggestion here is to just avoid the bottom quarter, which is mostly composed of foods you know you should avoid, like hot dogs and soda. Try to get as much food as possible in the top quarter, but don't worry if you dip into the second and third quarters. To avoid having to carry around this list - or worse yet, memorize the ONQI algorithm - here are two guidelines to help you structure your diet in accordance with the ONQI system.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eat as many fruits and vegetables as possible.<\/strong> The foods that achieve ratings of 75-100 are overwhelmingly fruits and vegetables - and for good reason. Humans have eaten these foods for tens of thousands of years and they're absolutely packed with nutrients.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make fish your primary protein source.<\/strong> One not entirely obvious result of the ONQI system is the high ranking of so many types of fish. As you can see, most fish beat red meats, turkey, and chicken. Most fish are in the top quarter, while the others don't make it above 50.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are two great recipes to get you started. As you can see, many of their ingredients rank in the top category in the chart above.<\/p>\n<h4>Pan-Seared Halibut with Quinoa Salad<\/h4>\n<p><img style=\"height: 178px;\" title=\"Pan-Seared Halibut with Quinoa Salad\" src=\"http:\/\/cook123.com\/assets\/contentsFiles\/images\/recipe\/Pan_Seared_Halibut_with_Quinoa_Salad.jpg\" alt=\"Pan-Seared Halibut with Quinoa Salad\" height=\"178px\" \/><br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p>This great recipe combines two top tier foods: halibut and quinoa.

While it does have few or no calories, the drawbacks to the artificially sweetened beverages far outweigh this benefit.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we uncover the less glamorous side of diet sodas. With all of the negative effects that diet sodas can cause, what may have once appealed to you will surely lose its fizz.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Pros<\/h3>\n<p>The only real advantage to diet soda is that it doesn&rsquo;t contain any refined sugar. Compared to the high levels of added sugar in regular soda (usually around 30-40g\/can), this is a true benefit. Cutting out this amount of refined sugar not only keeps your total consumed calories lower; it lowers your risk for obesity, diabetes, and heart problems like hypertension and heart disease.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Cons<\/h3>\n<p>The drawback to cutting out refined sugar, though, is that diet soda is full of artificial sweeteners. This both alters the taste of the soda and brings on an onslaught of other problems.&nbsp; Recent studies on the effects of drinking diet soda suggest that those people who do so on a daily basis may have an elevated risk for heart attack and stroke. This is unique to diet soda. No such correlation exists with regular soda. In addition, other research has shown a link between drinking diet soda and the development of metabolic syndrome and type-2 diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Possibly the most shocking problem with diet soda is that it may actually cause weight <em>gain<\/em>. The issue stems from the fact that the artificial sweeteners used in diet soda are intensely sweet but have no calories. As a result, the body loses touch with the correlation between sweetness and calorie management. Thus, tasting something sweet ceases to be a&nbsp;trigger to stop taking in calories for diet soda drinkers, which leads to these people eating more sweet foods and gaining weight.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Takeaway<\/h3>\n<p>Besides hydration, diet soda can&rsquo;t benefit you in any way from a nutrition standpoint&mdash;so why drink it? Water is still your best bet for hydration, but milk and certain fruit juices are healthy options, too.

Many manufactures of the popular condiment have come out with healthier alternatives to their original mayo recipes. By using canola or olive oil, mayonnaise producers hope to appeal to a more health-food-oriented customer base.<\/p>\n<p>Using these oils instead of alternative, less nutritious options may actually have some effect on increasing the healthiness of the end product. At the same time, mayonnaise is still mayonnaise, and even in moderation, is calorie-rich. This article explores what it means to be a healthy mayonnaise and if it is worth all of the fuss.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>What Makes an Oil Good?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Typical vegetable oil used for cooking is high in saturated fat.

In addition, canola oil has high levels of polyunsaturated fats like Omega-6 and Omega-3, which are known for their health benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Olive oil is also rather well-known for its health benefits.

As a result, there is less harm and more reason to use mayo if it has olive or canola oils.

In this article, we look at the hidden benefits of this family of plants.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Onions, etc.<\/h3>\n<p>Onions, as well as shallots, leeks, and scallions, are composed of mostly water. Compared to other alliums, these vegetables possess&nbsp;lower vitamin and mineral levels as a result. They do, however, contain sulfides that lower blood pressure, as well as the antioxidant quercetin. This nutrient is an anti-inflammatory agent that helps people suffering from arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Chives<\/h3>\n<p>Chives, unlike the vegetable alliums mentioned above, is an herb, meaning its stem is what is used. They have lower levels of the same nutrients that can be found in the vegetable alliums. Thus the health benefits, while present, are somewhat milder, as is the taste of this herb.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Garlic<\/h3>\n<p>Garlic certainly possesses a strong flavor, so it may be difficult to work into your diet if you&rsquo;re not used to it. It&rsquo;s worth it, however, based on the antioxidant content alone. The antioxidants in garlic, allicin in particular, help improve your heart health by lowering blood pressure and LDL Cholesterol levels.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Side Effects<\/h3>\n<p>All of these plants are very aromatic, so if you live with chronic bad breath or have body odor issues, allium herbs and vegetables might be something to avoid.

When it comes to finding a healthy balance between your meal plan (and your children's) as well as one's sweet tooth, many of us are often confused when looking for satisfactory alternatives. When parents do find certain alternatives at their local supermarket, they are faced with choosing products fabricated in laboratories and that are more often that not produced unnaturally. Luckily natural sugars, or nutritive sweeteners, do exist to satisfy any child's sweet tooth.<\/p>\n<p>When we think of natural sugars one that immediately comes to mind is maple syrup. It has recently been discovered to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help fight certain diseases such as diabetes. It is also said that the polyphenols found in the syrup could help control glucose levels with patients living with type II diabetes. That said, it's not recommended to just start adding maple syrup to everything in sight. In fact, one teaspoon of maple syrup has a similar glycemic index to one teaspoon of regular sugar and can therefore increase blood sugar levels. However, when incorporated to a healthy and balanced meal plan, a small amount of maple syrup can safely be used as an alternative to white sugar.<\/p>\n<p>Another natural sweetener that was initially used many years ago by the Aztec people is Agave nectar. The nectar is derived from the Agave plant, the same plant from which tequila is derived, and has a honey-like taste and consistency. Agave is said to have about half of the glycemic index of regular sugar thus taking longer to increase blood sugar levels. However, Agave nectar is sweeter than sugar and should be used moderately in recipes as it quickly sweetens baked goods. Agave nectar is actually trending among the health-conscious crowds and is easily found in most supermarkets.<\/p>\n<p>The sweetest of all natural sugars, Stevia, comes from a plant known as the Stevia plant. This nutritive sweetener is said to be a whopping 200-300 times sweeter than regular sugar! Stevia has been used medicinally for years as an herbal sweetener and is said to have anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Stevia is actually recommended for people living with diabetes as it is actually calorie-free and does not affect blood glucose levels. If parents are looking to sweeten their child's oatmeal, a little bit of Stevia will do. However, due to its incredible sweetness, parents should be careful when adding Stevia to recipes.<\/p>\n<p>Whether using common natural sugars such as maple syrup, honey and brown sugar, or naturally derived sugars like Agave nectar and Stevia, parents should always be mindful to test their child's blood glucose level to ensure that they are as healthy as possible. Parents can also substitute sugar in baked goods recipes with homemade sugar-free applesauce. Ultimately, the most recommended way to satisfy a child's sweet tooth is by having them eat fruit as most fruit have low glycemic indexes and offer nutritious vitamins and fibers.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/healthy-during-holidays.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Excessive sugar intake and diabetes are a serious concern, especially around the Holidays.

Month after month, year after year, gym-goers rapidly lose their newfound interest in fitness. The reasons for this range from boring or dangerous routines to lack of motivation or results. Exercise doesn't have to be like this. If you suffer from any of these problems, you need a personal trainer!<\/p>\n<p>Before you reject the idea because of the cost, consider the many benefits of working with a personal trainer. First and foremost, a trainer will teach you how to exercise safely and effectively. Every sport is coached from an early age, but gym-goers are expected to learn exercises and develop fitness programs on their own.<\/p>\n<p>Exercise physiology is a complex field - personal trainers have certifications and degrees for a reason. A personal trainer will utilize his or her expertise to ensure that you get positive results, not injuries. And when you do decide to stop working with the trainer, you'll have a wealth of information to bring to fitness programs you take on down the road.<\/p>\n<p>Second, a personal trainer will keep you motivated and accountable. Everyone makes excuses to put off going to the gym. And once we're there, when our workouts get tough, we give up early. When you're working out alone, it's tough to push yourself to run an extra mile or get another rep.<\/p>\n<p>All this changes with a personal trainer. Trainers hold their clients accountable for showing up to the gym for each workout. And once you get to the gym, the trainer will motivate you throughout your workout to reach your potential.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, a personal trainer can develop a highly individualized fitness program for you. This customization will occur at every level of your new routine. A trainer can tailor your program to your goals: whether you want to lose weight, gain muscle, or even prepare for an upcoming marathon, a trainer can help you realize these goals. Next, a trainer will take into account your athletic background, including your injury history, health issues, and current fitness level. They do the research so you don't have to! And finally, a trainer can make changes to your program based on how you enjoy working out. A key reason why many people stop training is that they dislike their program. A trainer can replace exercises you don't like and still keep your program effective.<\/p>\n<p>If you're convinced that personal training is the way to go, here are three tips to maximize the benefits of working with a trainer.<\/p>\n<ol><ol>\n<li>Talk to many different trainers and determine their education, experience, personality, and training style. Watch them in action training other members. When you find someone you are interested in contracting as your personal trainer, purchase just one session and go from there.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol><ol>\n<li>Share the session with a friend. A one-on-one session with a trainer can cost over $75, but if you split the cost with a friend, it will only cost you under $50. Plus the friendly competition will motivate you even more.<\/li>\n<\/ol><\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trust your personal trainer, but ask plenty of questions about why you are doing what you are doing. This will help you learn from your trainer's expertise and eventually be able to be your own personal trainer.<\/li>\n<\/ol>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/personal-training.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Getting a personal trainer may just be worth the extra cost.

For many others, the thought of wasting money to get something that is practically free in every home seems ludicrous.&nbsp; While the popularity of bottled water is booming, many are wondering if there are really any extra benefits to drinking bottled water.<\/p>\n<p>The reason behind the rise in the popularity of bottled water could be attributed to the overall shift in health consciousness across the nation. Rather than reach for sugary sports drinks or caloric sodas, people are grabbing their water bottles to quench their thirst.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Difference?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Simply, there is not much difference between bottled water and tap water. In terms of safety, bottled water and tap water are comparable. Our water supply is monitored and tested constantly by the Environmental Protection Agency, while bottled water is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Both groups use similar safety standards.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in the Tap?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the main differences between tap and bottled water is that tap water usually includes a chlorine disinfectant, meant to guard against any potential harmful bacteria. This could lead to the water not tasting as good as it would without it. Bottled water uses ozone disinfectant, which has no odor or taste.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, tap water often contains some fluoride, which is very beneficial for healthy teeth. In fact drinking fluorinated water is enough for most people to reach their recommended daily intake of fluoride. Simply drinking tap water is one of the best ways to prevent tooth decay. Those who drink exclusively bottled water should look for alternate ways to intake fluoride.<\/p>\n<p>Some minerals that are important in water are calcium and magnesium. Death rates tend to be lower in areas with tap water containing higher levels of calcium and magnesium, according to a Duke University study. Depending on where you live, the levels of these minerals in water are consistent in tap and bottled water. You get the same health benefits from both.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in the Bottle?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are varying degrees of bottled water. You have your standard grocery store bottles as well as your premium water bottles that will run you a few extra bucks. Despite the packaging, close to half the bottled water in the United States is just filtered tap water.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the premium brands do have interesting sources. <strong>&Eacute;<\/strong>vian, for example, is drawn from a spring in the French village of &Eacute;vian-les-Bains. The water you are drinking is originally melted alpine snow. And Fiji water does actually source its water from Fiji. Any potential health benefits for these brands over other brands and tap water is minimal though. The extra money you spend won&rsquo;t provide you with additional health benefits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The tap water versus bottled water debate comes down to personal preference.

In the third corner, you have the raw milk movement and in the fourth corner, there are the alternate milk movements. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>With four corners, you may be reminded of a boxing ring and you wouldn&rsquo;t be far off from the truth.&nbsp; There a lot of people with very strong feelings about milk, often culminating in heated exchanges. &nbsp;What we&rsquo;d like to do is to simply provide an overview of each of these viewpoints.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Milk is bad <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This viewpoint is often offered by people who suffer sensitivities or intolerances to dairy products. However, even without an intolerance problem, several other reasons exist.&nbsp; One is that humans are the only species that drinks milk past infanthood, which makes drinking milk unnatural and unnecessary.&nbsp; Another is that dairy contains lactose, which is composed of glucose and galactose. For those who wish to limit all sugars, limiting dairy might be the right option.<\/p>\n<p>They also point to the fact that you can get enough calcium through other food sources such as dark leafy greens, almonds and salmon to forgo drinking milk.&nbsp; Add in some weight bearing exercises, which help your body process calcium much better and you will be meeting your calcium needs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Milk is good <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dairy does have some very good nutrients.&nbsp; It provides protein, calcium, vitamin D, phosphorous, and essential fatty acids.&nbsp; Certainly, the FDA recommends two to three cups of milk per day for each person no matter the age.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While it is true that other food sources such as leafy greens, nuts and seafood &nbsp;give you the same nutrients that are found in milk, milk puts all of these nutrients in one convenient and simple package.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Raw milk movement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Proponents of raw milk believe that pasteurization kills healthy enzymes and beneficial bacteria so necessary for healthy bone development. They state that although pasteurization kills unhealthy bacteria, if you get your milk from a clean dairy, which humanely raises their cattle without the use of steroids and antibiotics, pasteurization is simply not needed.<\/p>\n<p>Large agencies, such as the CDC and the FDA strongly urge people not to ever consume raw dairy due to the risk of the milk being contaminated. If the milk is contaminated with something like e-coli, it could negatively affect your health.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alternate Milks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For vegans or for those who are lactose intolerant to cow&rsquo;s milk, they may include other milks into their diet.&nbsp; These include soy milk, almond milk or even goat or elk milk.&nbsp; These milks are as healthy as their respective ingredient lists, which&nbsp;vary widely&nbsp;between&nbsp;brands and production methods&nbsp;are worth their own investigations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Bottom Line<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The fact is that ingesting dairy is a personal decision and you should do your research and listen to your body when making the choice. Studies do show that, for people without sensitivities or intolerances, adding dairy does have a positive impact on physical health.

But sushi has become an extremely popular meal throughout the country nowadays. You&rsquo;ll see countless couples out on sushi dates on Friday nights, and some people even enjoy making their own sushi at home. But the rise of sushi&rsquo;s popularity brings up some important health questions. Eating raw fish has some downsides and plenty of health benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Before you reach for that next spicy tuna roll, there are certain things you should know about eating raw fish and sushi.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Look for quality<\/strong>: Most sushi restaurants are known for their high quality fish. But if you go to a place that is lacking in quality, it is possible to get a parasite from eating the raw fish. Symptoms of ingesting a parasite are very similar to food poisoning &ndash; nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, to name a few. So if you are going to get sushi, make sure you go to a reputable place. You don&rsquo;t want to end up keeled over after dinner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Great nutrients: <\/strong>Sushi and raw fish are loaded with nutrients that are good for your body. Most contain omega-3 fatty acids, which help lower cholesterol, improve your cardiovascular system, and decrease the risk of getting cancer. Calcium and vitamin D are also present in many sushi dishes. You can even get your fill of protein if you choose the right sushi. If you go light on the rice and the high-sodium soy sauce, sushi is one of the healthiest dishes someone can order.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t eat too much: <\/strong>Even if you are a diehard sushi lover, you should not be eating it too often. Eating sushi more than six times a week can lead to mercury poisoning, since there is a significant level of mercury in all raw fish (and especially big fish). Mercury poisoning could lead to issues with your nervous system. The high levels of mercury will also offset the benefits of the omega-3 fatty acids.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Healthier sushi: <\/strong>One way to make your sushi a bit healthier is to substitute your white rice for brown rice, as many places are now offering that alternative. Don&rsquo;t overload the sushi with spicy mayo or bits of tempura as it will significant up the calorie count. A small piece of sushi may not look like much, but add the wrong thing and you could be looking at a fatty meal.<\/p>\n<p>Sushi and raw fish are generally very healthy for us. The health benefits far outweigh the potential risks associated with eating raw fish. As long as you are smart about your portions and don&rsquo;t go overboard with eating sushi every day, it is a great meal.

There is a small sect of people who are challenging the norms of eating habits. &nbsp;They think that eating up to six smaller meals a day could be better for you.<\/p>\n<p>There are always new diets popping up promising to help people lose weight. The idea behind eating small meals every few hours is that it will decrease your appetite and increase your energy level. To eat more often, you would actually eat less. While this may be true in some circumstances, this type of eating ritual has its cons as well. Here are some pros and cons of eschewing the standard three meals a day in favor of several smaller meals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Healthy Diet:<\/strong> The basic strategy for this meal plan is to eat breakfast within one hour of waking up, and then eat every three hours after that, stopping three hours before you go to sleep. As long as you adhere to a typical healthy diet and stay on schedule, this should decrease appetite. But mainly, if the diet is right, reducing caloric intake is what matters most. For some, this is the best method to achieve that. Eating a little bit throughout the day, if it is a real meal, will prevent snacking and help with weight loss.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Time consuming:<\/strong> It could be labor intensive to stick to the routine.

It's said to be the perfect drink for staying focused and feeling energized. &nbsp;Bulletproof coffee consists of black coffee made from low-toxin beans which is then mixed in a blender with grass-fed butter and medium-chain triglyceride oil. &nbsp;The supercharged cup of joe is popular among Paleo dieters and low-carb eaters.

Be sure to use butter from grass-fed cows, as it contains a healthy ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brain Function: <\/strong>Bulletproof coffee has a large effect on brain function because the fat increases the body&rsquo;s absorption of caffeine. The effect is a bit stronger than if you have caffeine on its own. Bulletproof coffee is supposed to give you a long lasting focus &ndash; you won&rsquo;t crash after a couple of hours as you may with regular coffee.<\/p>\n<p><strong>All about the MCTs: <\/strong>One of the main reasons bulletproof coffee is said to be so beneficial to our body is the medium-chain triglycerides - or MCTs for short. MCTs are not as likely to get stored in fatty tissue because they are digested quicker and are said to have a hand in weight loss. While proponents of bulletproof coffee claim that they also help boost performance when it comes to exercise, it is still not certain if that is the case.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t use it to replace a meal: <\/strong>Some people have taken to using bulletproof coffee to replace their breakfast in the morning.

Whether it is for health reasons or because they are morally opposed, there is no question that a diet without meat has its benefits and downsides.<\/p>\n<p>According to a study by the Vegetarian Times, 7.3 million Americans &ndash; over 3% - keep a vegetarian diet. More and more people are giving up their carnivorous lifestyle, which means they need to get the essential nutrients most people get from meat elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the pros and cons of following a strictly vegetarian diet:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health benefits<\/strong>: There are plenty of health benefits to cutting meat out of your diet. Most notably, avoiding meat lowers a person&rsquo;s risk of cardiovascular disease, lowers blood pressure, and actually increases life expectancy. Having a balanced vegetarian diet that includes fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains will help vegetarians get the potassium and dietary fiber they need. By avoiding meat you also avoid unnecessary saturated fat and cholesterol, which is great for cardiovascular health.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stay in Shape<\/strong>: Vegetarians tend to have better fitness than meat eaters. People with vegetarian diets are less likely to be obese, according to Livestrong. Thanks in large part to low-calorie, very filling foods like vegetables and beans, vegetarians will not overeat as much as non-vegetarians. Cutting out the fatty meats will limit the risk of obesity, and in turn diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Missing Nutrients<\/strong>: There are some nutrients that are most easily acquired from eating meat. B-12, a vitamin that is essential to any healthy diet, is only found naturally in animal-based foods, according to LiveStrong. If the goal is only to avoid meat, dieters can get this vitamin from foods such as eggs or other dairy products. Otherwise they can take them in supplement form.&nbsp; Omega-3 fatty acid levels are high in fish, and vegetarians will need to get their necessary filling from walnuts or supplements. Vegetarians tend to have lower levels of zinc as well. This can be rectified by eating soy foods and nuts, which will help with zinc intake.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mistaken health assumptions<\/strong>: It is common to automatically assume that a vegetarian diet is a healthy diet. But this is not always true &ndash; vegetarians must watch what they eat much like the rest of us. Vegetarians need to find a good balance of foods that are both healthy, enticing, and will provide them with the necessary vitamins and minerals. Vegetarians can easily stick by their credo by eating sugary and buttery foods, which negates all of the presumed health benefits. Additionally, your body needs a certain amount of calories a day to run at peak performance. Eating significantly less than the required calories can decrease energy levels.<\/p>\n<p>Talk to a doctor before making any drastic changes to your diet. A vegetarian diet is perfectly healthy &ndash; as long as they find the right balance.&nbsp;<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/Vegetarian_pros_cons.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Many assumptions are made about vegetarian diets, but not all are true.

Another is a gastro-intestinal virus seen throughout the company. &nbsp;Since we already know they&rsquo;re making their rounds, the question is what can you do to help stave off these viruses?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lifestyle changes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1. Make sure to exercise.&nbsp; Adding in some cardio or weight building exercises will help enhance the immune system.&nbsp; But the cardio is especially good. This is because it enhances the cardio-vascular system, delivering extra oxygen to the blood and strengthening the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. Don&rsquo;t smoke, and stay away from people who do. Viruses, especially viruses that affect the respiratory system, can become much worse when you are exposed to cigarette smoke.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. Relax and don&rsquo;t let stress get to you.&nbsp; Excess stress lowers the immune system and can make you more susceptible to any viruses or bugs going around.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. Keep your hands washed and stay away from others.&nbsp; Many bugs are passed from casual contact between people, such as shaking hands or talking on the same phone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dietary Changes:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1. Eat food with phytochemicals. These are found in vegetables and fruits with a dark green, red or yellow color.&nbsp; Phytochemicals are known to have anti-viral properties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2. Think stink!&nbsp; Stinky food, that is.&nbsp; Foods such as garlic, onions, horseradish, cayenne pepper and ginger can help.&nbsp; Onions contain quercetin, which boosts immune system and reduces mucous.&nbsp; Allicin, found in garlic, fights infections.&nbsp; Horseradish increases blood flow and increases sweat, which removes toxins from the body.&nbsp; Cayenne pepper contains antioxidants and ginger opens your sinuses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>3. Adding in herbal remedies such as Echinacea, zinc, vitamin c, or goldenseal can help the body better fight off flu and cold germs.&nbsp; If you add by making a hot tea, the steam will help clear out sinuses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>4. Stay hydrated.&nbsp; Drink plenty of water and juices with high levels of Vitamin C.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What to do if you do get sick<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>If you do end up getting sick anyway, your first item of business is to drink plenty of fluids.&nbsp; If you get a stomach virus, limit foods until your stomach starts to feel better than slowly add in soft foods.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Although considered a traditional remedy, chicken soup actually works!&nbsp; In recent years, scientific studies have proven that chicken soup works sometimes as good as or better than over the counter medications.&nbsp; Many scientists believe that the combination of protein, broth and vegetables all contribute to its effectiveness.&nbsp; &nbsp;Outside of all of that, the steam from a nice hot bowl of chicken soup helps to clear the sinus cavities and makes breathing easier.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important things you can do is to keep away from others.&nbsp; If you are still contagious, make sure to stay away from work, school and other areas where you could contaminate others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/Avoid_sick.jpg","image_url_small":"\/generic_article.png","meta_description":"Being sick is miserable.

The fact is that you don&rsquo;t have to purchase the meal option and in fact, you may be doing good to purchase the main dish and ask for water, coffee or unsweetened tea to drink.&nbsp; <br \/> <br \/> And when it comes to alcoholic drinks, all choices contain a high amount of calories, reduces your body&rsquo;s ability to burn fat and provides little to no nutrition.&nbsp; If you choose to get a mixed drink, your choice gets no better.&nbsp; The mix options for one drink may contain more sugar than a bowl of ice cream.<\/li>\n<li>Order half-portions.&nbsp; Portion sizes in restaurants have greatly increased over the past twenty years.&nbsp; Normal plate sizes today used to be family-sized serving dishes years ago.&nbsp; As you place your order, ask if you can order half a portion. If the restaurant cannot comply, ask that half your portion be boxed for take-home before it&rsquo;s even served to you.&nbsp; This way, you are getting back to a more normal portion size right at the start.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Stick with the appetizers or side dishes.&nbsp; Some appetizers, like bruschetta, ginger shrimp, chicken tacos and even mini-burgers can be a good choice so long as you choose the appetizer as your main meal.&nbsp; Side dishes, such as broth-based soup and salads can also make a great main course. &nbsp;Make sure to limit the toppings for these choices, such as sour cream, salad dressings,&nbsp;croutons or cheeses to keep the choice healthy.<\/p>","introText":"","image_url":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/Dining_out.jpg","image_url_small":"\/articlesContents\/Diet\/Dining_out.jpg","meta_description":"Dining out at a restaurant can lead to unhealthy choices, but these tips can help you remain healthy while still enjoying your time out.","date_published":"2014-10-31 13:36:00","published":"1","seo_url":"tips-for-dining-out-healthy.html","aggregate_rating":"0","aggregate_votes":"0","aggregate_views":"394","author":"2"},{"id":"826","name":"Six Ways to Make Cheat Days Work For You","body":"<p>We all know that one person who starts a diet.&nbsp; She does great for six days and then decides to add in a cheat day so she can have some take-out pizza.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t eat it all in one sitting, so since she&rsquo;s going to have some leftover pizza, she&rsquo;s going to extend her cheat day so as not to waste food.&nbsp; When she gets to work, she finds that it&rsquo;s someone&rsquo;s birthday so she has that afternoon piece of cake.&nbsp; Pretty soon, that one cheat day turns into a failed diet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why have cheat days?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cheat days have long been used to help someone stay on a diet longer.&nbsp; It is used so that the dieter doesn&rsquo;t feel deprived of her favorite food choices.&nbsp; It turns out that adding in several days during the week when you have a higher consumption of calories can actually help the body better metabolize food during days when food is limited.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t call them cheat days in your diet.&nbsp; Diets end and once they do, cheat days become the norm.&nbsp; Instead, look at your dietary choices as a lifelong food plan; one that is designed to have fluctuations in terms of daily caloric intake.
